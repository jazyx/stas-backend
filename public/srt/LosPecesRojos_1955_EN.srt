1
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:30,053
THE RED FISHES

2
00:01:41,501 --> 00:01:44,549
Just like the last four days, today
the stormy northwest wind has continued...

3
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:48,459
...lashing the coast, and it seems
it ain't gonna decrease its fury.

4
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:52,316
The sea's appearance is astonishing.
The harbor is still closed.

5
00:02:22,357 --> 00:02:23,613
- Good night.
- Good night.

6
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:25,631
- What a night!
- Dreadful.

7
00:02:26,775 --> 00:02:28,321
Sorry, I didn't see you.

8
00:02:28,324 --> 00:02:30,573
- Is that noise the sea?
- Yes, Miss. It's been the same...

9
00:02:30,575 --> 00:02:32,868
- ...for a week...
- Sounds like it might burst in here!

10
00:02:32,869 --> 00:02:34,116
You've got free rooms, haven't you?

11
00:02:34,185 --> 00:02:38,525
You can have the entire hotel.
Gijon is dead in the off-season.

12
00:02:38,527 --> 00:02:41,401
- We want three rooms with bathrooms.
- Three?

13
00:02:41,781 --> 00:02:43,211
What's Carlos doing out there?

14
00:02:43,215 --> 00:02:45,471
He's staring at a shop window
beside the hotel.

15
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:49,681
Hugo, do you hear the sea?
It must be tremendous.

16
00:02:50,257 --> 00:02:52,500
I would like to get
closer to see it.

17
00:02:52,615 --> 00:02:55,372
Would you please go outside and
tell that dummy to come in?

18
00:02:55,768 --> 00:02:57,637
Kids nowadays...

19
00:02:57,667 --> 00:03:01,002
- Is that all your luggage, Sir?
- No, outside there's a big valise.

20
00:03:01,062 --> 00:03:03,536
No, no, let him get it inside,
let him take the trouble.

21
00:03:04,408 --> 00:03:07,564
Well, Carlos, I accept your gift but now
get inside, your father's getting angry.

22
00:03:07,584 --> 00:03:10,806
What? No way, it's too
cold to go outside.

23
00:03:10,826 --> 00:03:12,884
You'll see it tomorrow.
Come on, hurry up.

24
00:03:13,234 --> 00:03:16,308
Sign here, Ivan.
Let my son fill out his own.

25
00:03:16,486 --> 00:03:19,490
- Well, being a kid...
- A kid? He's nineteen,

26
00:03:19,495 --> 00:03:22,202
...if you think he's a kid...
Can you rent our rooms together?

27
00:03:22,212 --> 00:03:24,152
Yes, whatever you like.
The whole hotel is empty.

28
00:03:24,155 --> 00:03:27,089
I'll give you the second floor
suite, it's the best one.

29
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:32,570
May I, please?

30
00:03:36,302 --> 00:03:38,102
What are you waiting for?
For my son?

31
00:03:38,106 --> 00:03:42,256
Not at all.
Let him use his legs.

32
00:03:58,224 --> 00:03:59,629
This way.

33
00:03:59,811 --> 00:04:01,820
Poor boy, Carlos must be
tired too.

34
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:04,163
It's at the end of the corridor.

35
00:04:09,477 --> 00:04:12,445
- Do you like it?
- Yeah, very good.

36
00:04:13,023 --> 00:04:15,182
I would like to take a shower.
Is there hot water?

37
00:04:15,185 --> 00:04:18,327
Yes, Miss.
It was boiling a while ago.

38
00:04:18,541 --> 00:04:20,417
That's your room.

39
00:04:22,841 --> 00:04:26,134
This one is yours.
For you and your son.

40
00:04:29,057 --> 00:04:33,132
- Can we have dinner?
- Sure, but it must be cold meats,

41
00:04:33,136 --> 00:04:36,500
...look what time it is.
- Cold meat for three,

42
00:04:36,504 --> 00:04:39,427
...and three bottles of beer.
- I'll tell the waitress.

43
00:04:39,437 --> 00:04:41,317
Hey! And three cups of coffee.

44
00:04:41,493 --> 00:04:43,715
Ask the lady if she prefers
a cup of tea.

45
00:04:47,709 --> 00:04:49,103
Miss?

46
00:04:49,637 --> 00:04:51,853
Miss...

47
00:04:57,045 --> 00:04:59,907
Wow, she's boiling!

48
00:05:16,084 --> 00:05:20,053
How nice.
What a lovely kid!

49
00:05:20,055 --> 00:05:23,523
You could have got your
suitcase upstairs, pretty boy.

50
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:32,545
Damn it! Why haven't you stuck it
in a place I know?

51
00:05:34,927 --> 00:05:37,295
Carlos Pascal, nineteen.

52
00:05:37,958 --> 00:05:40,509
I'll put you in jail
the same number of years!

53
00:05:45,601 --> 00:05:48,680
- How frightening! The sound of the sea!
- Good night, miss.

54
00:05:48,845 --> 00:05:51,297
- It's been the same all week.
- It must be tremendous.

55
00:05:51,339 --> 00:05:53,603
- Which is the best place to see it?
- Santa Catalina...

56
00:05:53,606 --> 00:05:55,502
...a promontory near by.

57
00:05:55,512 --> 00:05:59,116
But they shouldn't go there,
it's terribly windy.

58
00:05:59,119 --> 00:06:01,252
The view must be astonishing.

59
00:06:01,255 --> 00:06:02,859
Why don't we get closer?

60
00:06:02,861 --> 00:06:05,174
- Will he want to come?
- Sure, he will want to.

61
00:06:05,371 --> 00:06:08,307
Hey, Carlos, would you like to...?
Stop that music.

62
00:06:08,309 --> 00:06:11,972
I warn you it is very dangerous,
I won't go there even if...

63
00:06:11,975 --> 00:06:14,983
- Besides, it's very dark.
- Well, it's only once in a lifetime.

64
00:06:15,064 --> 00:06:17,109
As you like. You're gonna
get wet anyway.

65
00:06:17,119 --> 00:06:18,824
- I'll wear my raincoat.
- O.K.

66
00:06:18,826 --> 00:06:21,063
And the umbrella, if the wind
doesn't blow it away.

67
00:06:21,066 --> 00:06:22,447
I will take both.

68
00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:23,747
Hugo, tell him to hurry up.

69
00:06:23,757 --> 00:06:25,549
Carlos, hurry up,
the dinner is ready.

70
00:06:25,559 --> 00:06:27,344
At your service, colonel.

71
00:06:27,347 --> 00:06:30,605
O.K., let's go.
Good night and enjoy your meal.

72
00:06:39,923 --> 00:06:41,864
Help!

73
00:06:46,811 --> 00:06:49,503
Help!
Help!

74
00:06:50,002 --> 00:06:51,912
Help!

75
00:06:54,084 --> 00:06:56,046
Help!

76
00:07:00,313 --> 00:07:02,570
Hurry up!
They're in the dumping site.

77
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:06,501
Over there, in the dumping site.

78
00:07:46,005 --> 00:07:47,236
Come on, cool it.

79
00:07:47,338 --> 00:07:49,540
What happened?
Did he slip?

80
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:51,646
What were you doing here
at this hour of the night?

81
00:07:51,649 --> 00:07:55,470
- We went there to see the sea.
- Do you live in Gijón?

82
00:07:57,531 --> 00:07:59,676
We must look for him, I've gotta
look for him!

83
00:07:59,876 --> 00:08:02,974
Let me go! Come with me,
he could be alive.

84
00:08:03,021 --> 00:08:05,590
Let me go!
- Sit down!

85
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:12,448
O.K., what happened to your son?

86
00:08:15,904 --> 00:08:19,768
He was walking in front of us,
when we reached the dumping site...

87
00:08:20,605 --> 00:08:24,392
...he started running.
He entered the dumping site running.

88
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:31,606
I got scared. The wind was shaking us.
I shouted at him, but Carlos...

89
00:08:31,818 --> 00:08:35,396
...was always nuts.
Always crazy...

90
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:44,457
Always laughing. Suddenly, I saw
him jump, sit on the guardrail...

91
00:08:44,877 --> 00:08:48,280
...I run towards him, but...

92
00:08:48,487 --> 00:08:50,372
...I didn't get there in time.

93
00:08:50,596 --> 00:08:52,658
I saw him fall head over heels.

94
00:08:53,078 --> 00:08:59,208
He was falling in circles and shouting.
Those were horrible screams.

95
00:09:25,087 --> 00:09:27,007
- Where is he?
- What?

96
00:09:27,017 --> 00:09:30,350
- Where is the father?
- Down there, with the other men.

97
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:33,309
- Have you talked to his wife?
- Not yet, do you want me to interrogate her?

98
00:09:33,319 --> 00:09:34,838
Yeah, interrogate her.

99
00:09:41,403 --> 00:09:44,025
Please, miss, make an effort,
drink it.

100
00:09:44,035 --> 00:09:46,881
- Coffee will cheer you up.
- I don't want anything.

101
00:09:47,063 --> 00:09:48,535
Leave her alone.

102
00:09:50,905 --> 00:09:52,489
It'll be just a moment.

103
00:09:52,897 --> 00:09:55,933
I have to ask you a few questions.
You must understand it.

104
00:09:55,937 --> 00:09:57,307
Yes.

105
00:09:57,395 --> 00:09:59,797
What's the profession of your husband?
What's his work?

106
00:09:59,981 --> 00:10:03,295
He's not my husband, he's my fiancé.
We're gonna get married.

107
00:10:03,357 --> 00:10:07,019
- Well. What's his profession?
- He's a writer. Novelist.

108
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:09,981
Do you think they've found anything?

109
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:15,443
I should be there.
I should be by his side...

110
00:10:20,409 --> 00:10:22,327
Please, take it easy.

111
00:10:22,619 --> 00:10:25,361
What's your profession?
I've heard you're an actress.

112
00:10:25,381 --> 00:10:26,746
Yes, sir.

113
00:10:26,749 --> 00:10:29,685
What did you come for? I mean,
what was the reason for this trip?

114
00:10:30,405 --> 00:10:35,302
There was no special motive,
he had finished his novel and I...

115
00:10:35,717 --> 00:10:40,287
...I asked for some days off
and we convinced Carlos...

116
00:10:40,289 --> 00:10:43,404
...to come with us. We wanted
to travel all over the North.

117
00:10:43,408 --> 00:10:47,529
- Your fiancé is a widower, isn't he?
- No, sir, he's single.

118
00:10:47,617 --> 00:10:48,971
And the son?

119
00:10:49,051 --> 00:10:53,575
Carlos was a natural son, he
has his father's surname.

120
00:11:58,085 --> 00:12:01,306
I'm freezing.
Well, it's all over now.

121
00:12:01,488 --> 00:12:04,039
That stupid cop was really
annoying me.

122
00:12:04,198 --> 00:12:06,974
I wouldn't do this again, not
for all the gold in the world.

123
00:12:07,356 --> 00:12:10,766
- Why don't you change clothes?
- I must have fever.

124
00:12:11,644 --> 00:12:14,573
What a strange sensation
it is to lose a son.

125
00:12:14,624 --> 00:12:18,249
Don't talk nonsense.
Why don't you take a hot shower?

126
00:12:18,442 --> 00:12:20,788
I feel I have blood on my hands.

127
00:12:21,387 --> 00:12:23,507
Don't dramatize, nobody
is watching you.

128
00:12:23,517 --> 00:12:24,502
I really mean it!

129
00:12:24,589 --> 00:12:27,502
The matter is finished.
Well...

130
00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:29,863
...what do you say about
my performance?

131
00:12:29,873 --> 00:12:32,266
Do you think I deserve to be
in suburban theater?

132
00:12:32,269 --> 00:12:35,240
I would like to have seen
some others in my place.

133
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:38,044
You say that because you don't
know what having a son is like.

134
00:12:38,407 --> 00:12:41,400
- You don't know how you can love him.
- You can keep on loving him...

135
00:12:41,408 --> 00:12:44,720
- ...who prevents you from that?
- 19 years living with him...

136
00:12:44,891 --> 00:12:47,101
...feeling him by my side
day after day.

137
00:12:47,111 --> 00:12:49,621
Will you shut up?
Say no more nonsense.

138
00:12:50,011 --> 00:12:53,105
You're nervous.
Come on, smoke a cigarette.

139
00:12:53,115 --> 00:12:55,187
Why don't you start packing?

140
00:12:57,477 --> 00:13:02,350
We have bloodstained hands
whether you want to or not.

141
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:12,333
Only fifteen days ago, I didn't
realize I had a son.

142
00:13:12,761 --> 00:13:14,975
And now he's dead.

143
00:13:22,406 --> 00:13:25,101
Things started getting
tangled up that night.

144
00:13:25,121 --> 00:13:27,997
Ivón worked in that theatre,
she had a small role in...

145
00:13:27,999 --> 00:13:31,424
...that silly revue, but she
was happy. Well...

146
00:13:31,642 --> 00:13:36,902
...not that night. A letter drove
her up the wall. Just a letter.

147
00:13:37,294 --> 00:13:40,280
Or maybe it was the letterhead.

148
00:13:42,714 --> 00:13:44,515
On stage, Miss Ivón!

149
00:13:44,724 --> 00:13:48,572
Come on, Ivón, get to work.
How boring are those dummies...

150
00:13:48,576 --> 00:13:49,707
...in row 0.

151
00:13:49,717 --> 00:13:53,662
Hey, Magda, do I have an idiot face?
Come on, tell me, do I?

152
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:56,600
Well, don't worry, we'll find
work in another place.

153
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:58,367
I don't care about that.
I don't mind if the...

154
00:13:58,369 --> 00:14:00,316
...company goes into liquidation
or not.

155
00:14:00,319 --> 00:14:02,469
All I wanna know is if I have
an idiot face.

156
00:14:02,472 --> 00:14:04,449
Yes or no.
- What's the matter with you?

157
00:14:04,452 --> 00:14:06,803
If Hugo comes, tell him to wait
for me. I gotta talk with him.

158
00:14:06,805 --> 00:14:09,276
- What has he done to you?
- What am I gonna do to him? You should say.

159
00:14:17,228 --> 00:14:18,143
Hi, Manolo.

160
00:14:18,146 --> 00:14:20,785
Miss Ivón has been asking
for you all night long.

161
00:14:20,984 --> 00:14:23,400
- Yeah? Is she there?
- She has just left.

162
00:14:23,403 --> 00:14:26,065
Do you know it, Mr. Pascal?
This is over.

163
00:14:26,067 --> 00:14:29,077
- What happened? No audience?
- What? It's all sold out.

164
00:14:29,087 --> 00:14:32,876
There's been a row, do you understand?
There was a row between the...

165
00:14:33,086 --> 00:14:34,606
...and the "White Horse".

166
00:14:34,616 --> 00:14:36,767
The white horse?
Is there a horse in the play?

167
00:14:36,769 --> 00:14:40,707
Shut up and perform. And take care
of your own horse or I'll eat it.

168
00:16:22,586 --> 00:16:23,935
Hello, Ivón.

169
00:16:25,624 --> 00:16:28,549
Hello, darling.

170
00:16:29,707 --> 00:16:33,385
Do I have an idiot face?
Come on, tell me, do I?

171
00:16:33,401 --> 00:16:36,607
Don't you laugh at me. Get out of here!
I don't wanna see you no more!

172
00:16:36,705 --> 00:16:38,737
But, why?
What's up?

173
00:16:38,811 --> 00:16:41,129
I know everything, do you hear me?
Everything!

174
00:16:42,158 --> 00:16:46,891
So you're a writer, aren't you?
That's how you make a living, isn't it?

175
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,321
You're not a writer and
you have never been.

176
00:16:49,469 --> 00:16:52,131
Well, that's what the
publishers also say.

177
00:16:52,449 --> 00:16:56,436
- But, what is it all about?
- How ingenious you are!

178
00:16:56,509 --> 00:16:59,608
You know what I'm talking about.
You're not a writer...

179
00:16:59,618 --> 00:17:02,181
...and you're not waiting to
be published to marry me.

180
00:17:02,185 --> 00:17:04,151
It's not true that you ain't
got no money.

181
00:17:04,526 --> 00:17:06,707
You've had a bad dinner,
haven't you?

182
00:17:06,717 --> 00:17:09,556
Liar! Are you gonna deny
you are a millonaire?

183
00:17:09,558 --> 00:17:12,908
Yeah, millionaire. You're a millionaire
and you've been laughing at me.

184
00:17:14,009 --> 00:17:18,011
Come on, Ivón, don't be silly,
I swear upon my name Hugo...

185
00:17:18,016 --> 00:17:20,424
- Hugo is not your name!
- What are you saying?

186
00:17:20,427 --> 00:17:23,758
Your name is Carlos,
Carlos Pascal.

187
00:17:25,589 --> 00:17:27,451
How do you know it?

188
00:17:28,906 --> 00:17:31,359
I didn't know you were
dealing with banks.

189
00:17:31,369 --> 00:17:33,505
3,226,000 pesetas.

190
00:17:33,515 --> 00:17:37,415
- Where did you get that?
- 3,226,000 pesetas.

191
00:17:37,417 --> 00:17:40,885
It says so here. And you've been telling
me for a year when you get published...

192
00:17:40,888 --> 00:17:42,959
Where did you get it?
Caretaker gave it to you, didn't he?

193
00:17:42,963 --> 00:17:43,561
Yes.

194
00:17:43,564 --> 00:17:45,503
I've told you a thousand times
not to go to my house.

195
00:17:45,507 --> 00:17:48,291
I had to. I was desperate.

196
00:17:48,695 --> 00:17:52,189
You know the company goes into liquidation
on Saturday and I ain't got no place...

197
00:17:52,193 --> 00:17:54,036
...to rest my bones.

198
00:17:54,224 --> 00:17:55,939
You don't care about that.

199
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,506
- I wish I were a millionaire.
- You are, you cynic.

200
00:17:59,516 --> 00:18:02,908
- I make a living writing.
- How dare you?

201
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,130
- And my name is Hugo.
- Your name is Carlos.

202
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,618
Carlos is my son.

203
00:18:11,316 --> 00:18:13,373
Are you married?

204
00:18:14,231 --> 00:18:15,357
No.

205
00:18:16,156 --> 00:18:17,922
It was...

206
00:18:18,906 --> 00:18:21,294
...an affair, do you understand?

207
00:18:22,178 --> 00:18:24,142
We had a child.

208
00:18:24,608 --> 00:18:28,233
She didn't want to take care
of the baby and I hadn't...

209
00:18:28,236 --> 00:18:31,817
...the courage to abandon him.

210
00:18:32,256 --> 00:18:34,170
Who is she?

211
00:18:34,976 --> 00:18:36,850
Are you gonna be jealous?

212
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:40,944
It was 19 years ago.
- 19 years...

213
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:45,252
And I haven't seen her again.
I wouldn't recognize her now.

214
00:18:48,829 --> 00:18:51,084
Do you realize now why I hadn't
told you about it?

215
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:54,756
My son is almost your age.

216
00:18:54,971 --> 00:18:58,054
I should've told you from the
beginning, but I hadn't the courage.

217
00:18:58,941 --> 00:19:01,978
Well, this is over, isn't it?

218
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:07,169
Not for me. All I care about
is being your wife.

219
00:19:08,424 --> 00:19:09,679
Really?

220
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:12,757
You're an angel and I love you
more than anything.

221
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:19,196
You hit hard, but you're
an angel.

222
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:21,000
We'll get married soon.

223
00:19:21,002 --> 00:19:23,502
Why does your son have
those millions?

224
00:19:23,512 --> 00:19:25,956
Aunt Angela gave them to him.
When she knew I was having a baby...

225
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:28,708
...she put that money in the bank,
and I was disinherited.

226
00:19:28,804 --> 00:19:30,836
- Why?
- For having that baby.

227
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:34,266
She threw me out of his house.
She always had a very bad opinion of me.

228
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:37,116
She doesn't think
I'm a writer either.

229
00:19:37,118 --> 00:19:39,086
- We agree on that.
- Shut up.

230
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:42,062
Hey, does your son know
I'm your fiancé?

231
00:19:42,217 --> 00:19:44,880
I think so. We never talk
about that. Why?

232
00:19:44,885 --> 00:19:49,267
Well, he's a millionaire. Maybe
he won't like that I work here.

233
00:19:49,356 --> 00:19:50,734
What nonsense!

234
00:19:51,438 --> 00:19:54,136
- Do you wanna meet him?
- You think I should?

235
00:19:54,238 --> 00:19:57,128
Why not? I'm sure he'll
be very pleased.

236
00:19:57,334 --> 00:20:01,264
Don't think he's silly.
He thinks about women like I do.

237
00:20:01,476 --> 00:20:03,824
And what do you think
about them?

238
00:20:21,137 --> 00:20:24,821
Living in a place like this
having 3,226,000 pesetas.

239
00:20:24,912 --> 00:20:26,164
When did aunt Angela die?

240
00:20:26,167 --> 00:20:28,288
She's living in the field,
in a magnificent castle.

241
00:20:28,289 --> 00:20:31,600
Do you know what I'll do with that
money?
I'll live in "La Castellana".

242
00:20:31,608 --> 00:20:33,733
He's gonna live there.
He wants to buy a flat.

243
00:20:33,736 --> 00:20:36,107
Oh my God, what luck!
A very big one?

244
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:38,600
He says he wants so many rooms
to get lost in.

245
00:20:38,606 --> 00:20:40,587
- What nonsense.
- Nonsense?

246
00:20:40,589 --> 00:20:43,205
I like this house. It seems
genuine to me...

247
00:20:43,207 --> 00:20:46,137
...from a romantic Madrid. All this
environment has its charm.

248
00:20:46,338 --> 00:20:48,201
Its charm...

249
00:20:48,585 --> 00:20:49,885
Carlos!

250
00:20:50,089 --> 00:20:52,203
Carlos!
Are you there?

251
00:20:54,756 --> 00:20:57,116
Well, it seems he's not here.
Carlos!

252
00:20:57,776 --> 00:21:00,597
He must have gone for something.
He has left the light on.

253
00:21:00,999 --> 00:21:02,877
Maybe he'll come back in a while.

254
00:21:02,879 --> 00:21:06,137
You see? This is his room.
He's always here studying.

255
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:09,497
- Studying?
- He's finishing his third year of...

256
00:21:09,694 --> 00:21:11,566
...Look, he's left a note.

257
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:14,858
"Dad, I've gone to study
at Fernando's place."

258
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:19,668
"I'll be back late. Don't wait up
for me. See you tomorrow, colonel."

259
00:21:19,866 --> 00:21:21,047
Colonel?

260
00:21:21,214 --> 00:21:23,648
He's called me that ever since
he saw a movie about India.

261
00:21:23,838 --> 00:21:26,489
- What career is he studying for?
- Architecture.

262
00:21:26,494 --> 00:21:30,076
Well, should we go or do you
want a cup of coffee?

263
00:21:30,262 --> 00:21:33,000
He's a millionaire and he
studies. That's terrific.

264
00:21:33,002 --> 00:21:36,478
All of him is terrific: likeable,
a good boy and very clever.

265
00:21:36,903 --> 00:21:39,406
Don't you have any pictures
of him? Is he so ugly?

266
00:21:39,416 --> 00:21:42,160
Ugly? You're crazy.
Do you know how tall he is?

267
00:21:42,241 --> 00:21:45,218
1.85 meters, a Tarzan,
and his face...

268
00:21:46,062 --> 00:21:48,864
Good heavens, what a boy!

269
00:22:21,956 --> 00:22:24,144
- Let's take it in the sitting room.
- Yeah, as you like.

270
00:22:24,145 --> 00:22:27,495
I don't like to be in here.
I don't wanna see his personal things.

271
00:22:27,498 --> 00:22:30,427
I like him to be free.
Close the door.

272
00:22:31,364 --> 00:22:32,742
Turn on the light.

273
00:22:35,105 --> 00:22:38,567
I'm very happy today, Ivón.
I've been with a publisher this evening.

274
00:22:38,569 --> 00:22:41,276
I gave him my novel. He'll answer
me tomorrow, let's see if...

275
00:22:41,279 --> 00:22:43,522
...this time I'm luckier.
Here.

276
00:22:44,488 --> 00:22:48,108
What do you think of my flat?
It isn't as ugly as Carlos says.

277
00:22:48,509 --> 00:22:50,666
When he gets married and goes
to his flat in La Castellana...

278
00:22:50,669 --> 00:22:53,176
- ...you and I will move here.
- Does he have a girlfriend?

279
00:22:53,364 --> 00:22:56,056
I guess so.
I'm gonna bring more coffee.

280
00:22:56,066 --> 00:22:58,121
I never meddle with his things.

281
00:22:58,124 --> 00:22:59,710
A bitch.

282
00:22:59,715 --> 00:23:01,294
She'll be a girl just like
all the others.

283
00:23:01,297 --> 00:23:03,521
Think of it, a handsome millionaire.

284
00:23:03,738 --> 00:23:05,662
That's why's she got to be a bitch?

285
00:23:05,666 --> 00:23:08,409
She must have something special.
Carlos ain't no fool.

286
00:23:08,598 --> 00:23:11,886
- He's deeply in love.
- Have you met her?

287
00:23:12,067 --> 00:23:13,670
No.

288
00:23:15,895 --> 00:23:19,546
- Then, how do you know it?
- Well, I deduce it.

289
00:23:20,057 --> 00:23:21,347
Should I fill it up?

290
00:23:21,787 --> 00:23:25,000
One day I caught him in his
room kissing a picture and...

291
00:23:25,002 --> 00:23:26,717
...what a kiss!

292
00:23:38,665 --> 00:23:41,003
Do you know who was arriving
when I was leaving?

293
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:43,628
"The White Horse" in a big car.

294
00:23:43,848 --> 00:23:46,356
I bet he makes peace with the Tall
One
and the company doesn't go into...

295
00:23:46,358 --> 00:23:47,584
...liquidation on Saturday.

296
00:23:47,626 --> 00:23:50,010
What's the matter with you?
Did you have another dispute?

297
00:23:50,107 --> 00:23:53,084
Hey, what would you think if you
saw a man kissing a picture of you?

298
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:55,008
- That he's crazy about me.
- And what would you do?

299
00:23:55,012 --> 00:23:56,520
I would faint.

300
00:23:56,524 --> 00:24:00,076
And if he is also young,
handsome and an architect?

301
00:24:00,254 --> 00:24:03,509
Stop, please. How do you know
it was a picture of you?

302
00:24:03,512 --> 00:24:04,844
And he's also thinking of marrying.

303
00:24:04,904 --> 00:24:07,440
Please, Ivón, I suffer
from heart problems.

304
00:24:07,443 --> 00:24:10,887
- Which picture was it?
- Well, just for example...

305
00:24:11,109 --> 00:24:14,306
- ...say it was a picture of me.
- What an example!

306
00:24:14,308 --> 00:24:17,135
- He's crazy about me.
- Well, give him a couple of coins.

307
00:24:17,137 --> 00:24:19,900
- He doesn't need them, he has a lot.
- Oh, yeah?

308
00:24:19,917 --> 00:24:22,248
- Three million pesetas.
- Well, alright.

309
00:24:22,432 --> 00:24:25,710
- How much did you say?
- Three million pesetas.

310
00:24:27,102 --> 00:24:29,877
Do you know I heard three
million pesetas?

311
00:24:29,879 --> 00:24:31,970
I said three million pesetas.

312
00:24:32,196 --> 00:24:35,110
You see? I heard three million
pesetas again.

313
00:24:35,284 --> 00:24:37,263
Three, pal, three!

314
00:24:37,448 --> 00:24:41,706
Yeah, yeah, I understand three,
but after that I hear million.

315
00:24:41,716 --> 00:24:44,556
Millions, idiot, millions.

316
00:24:45,642 --> 00:24:48,722
Yeah, yeah, idiot. With three
million anyone is an idiot.

317
00:24:49,610 --> 00:24:53,316
He's gonna buy a huge flat in
La Castellana, with running water.

318
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,926
- Can you imagine that?
- No.

319
00:24:56,513 --> 00:25:00,176
All for himself?
- For himself or for him and me.

320
00:25:00,179 --> 00:25:02,300
- But, has he met Hugo?
- Yes.

321
00:25:02,506 --> 00:25:05,273
Well, so what?, I don't think
you're gonna vacillate.

322
00:25:05,407 --> 00:25:07,379
I don't think you're so silly.

323
00:25:07,492 --> 00:25:10,786
Silly idiot.
Is it possible?

324
00:25:11,129 --> 00:25:13,402
There's one thing I haven't
explained to you yet.

325
00:25:13,467 --> 00:25:15,300
The boy is...

326
00:25:15,985 --> 00:25:19,420
Look, I'll tell you tomorrow,
today I'm very tired.

327
00:25:20,482 --> 00:25:22,916
Don't you know if he has
a brother?

328
00:25:23,564 --> 00:25:24,716
Listen...

329
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:27,303
...what would happen if one day
I came to the theatre...

330
00:25:27,305 --> 00:25:31,454
...with my own car and with a
marvellous fur coat...

331
00:25:31,459 --> 00:25:34,052
...draped over my shoulders?

332
00:25:34,254 --> 00:25:37,604
I have always dreamt of that,
to have my own fur coat...

333
00:25:38,181 --> 00:25:40,557
...and let it lie upon
my shoulders.

334
00:26:10,466 --> 00:26:12,885
- Is Mr. Muro here?
- Yes, in his office.

335
00:26:22,369 --> 00:26:23,788
Come in.

336
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,004
Good morning.

337
00:26:35,903 --> 00:26:36,988
How are you?

338
00:26:41,399 --> 00:26:45,416
Well, I've just read it. Something
very curious happened to me.

339
00:26:45,473 --> 00:26:48,770
It interested me a lot.
It's amazing, one of the best...

340
00:26:48,771 --> 00:26:51,848
...I have ever read. But in the
last 30 pages, I was...

341
00:26:51,849 --> 00:26:55,391
...surprised. They're absurd,
that ending is complete nonsense.

342
00:26:55,395 --> 00:26:58,742
Illogical. What the hell happened?

343
00:26:59,411 --> 00:27:02,100
I'm not the one who decides
the ending but the characters.

344
00:27:02,106 --> 00:27:06,818
Right, characters command.
But characters are fictional.

345
00:27:07,003 --> 00:27:10,815
You haven't created men and women
but puppets, that's why...

346
00:27:10,816 --> 00:27:14,139
- ...the story is unbelievable.
- I think they're human.

347
00:27:14,536 --> 00:27:17,341
They live decently for some time
and then get tired of that.

348
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:21,691
All of us get tired of living
decently. Some admit it...

349
00:27:21,692 --> 00:27:25,885
...and others think it. There's a
rebel inside of us, and my characters...

350
00:27:25,888 --> 00:27:30,647
...revolt, because they're
human. Puppets never revolt.

351
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:34,680
As a publisher I'm interested in real
stories, that's what makes money...

352
00:27:34,686 --> 00:27:39,469
...people don't want fantasies.
It's
like in cinema, "neorealismo"...

353
00:27:39,656 --> 00:27:42,500
- ...the real life.
- Real life?

354
00:27:42,676 --> 00:27:45,735
You mean to show the rotten
insides of men and cities?

355
00:27:45,894 --> 00:27:48,495
In those films I have only seen
dirty streets, clothes hanging out...

356
00:27:48,497 --> 00:27:50,716
- ...and children full of snot.
- That's it, that's it, it's human.

357
00:27:50,719 --> 00:27:53,730
That it's human is fantasy!
Scratching, eating, sleeping...

358
00:27:53,735 --> 00:27:56,106
...and moving among dung
is also done by animals...

359
00:27:56,316 --> 00:27:57,730
...cows, for example.

360
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:10,404
Will you please stop
admiring yourself?

361
00:28:10,578 --> 00:28:13,591
Hey, do you think I'm fine
in this pic?

362
00:28:13,764 --> 00:28:18,027
- Amazing, sensational.
- Do you think he'll like it?

363
00:28:18,202 --> 00:28:20,091
Are you gonna send it to him?

364
00:28:20,095 --> 00:28:23,590
Sure, Ivón, send it to him.
And with a dedication in it.

365
00:28:23,802 --> 00:28:26,430
An insinuating one.
An indirect one.

366
00:28:27,449 --> 00:28:29,253
For example...

367
00:28:29,876 --> 00:28:33,125
- "I'm crazy about you."
- How can I say that?

368
00:28:33,324 --> 00:28:36,526
It must be something refined.
For example...

369
00:28:36,727 --> 00:28:42,106
- "To Carlos with affection."
- "With a lot of affection."

370
00:28:43,242 --> 00:28:47,412
Listen, do you know what I'd do?
I'd reserve a box for him tonight.

371
00:28:47,569 --> 00:28:49,836
For this evening, Hugo
is coming tonight.

372
00:28:49,838 --> 00:28:52,495
You're right. I'll ask the
management. Besides, write...

373
00:28:52,497 --> 00:28:55,708
...a note, tell him to come
for you at the end of the show.

374
00:28:58,467 --> 00:29:00,500
Rehearsal, miss, master is here.

375
00:29:00,502 --> 00:29:01,815
I'm coming...

376
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:37,933
I've always dreamt of mink,
of having a mink coat...

377
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:41,776
- ...and wearing it on my shoulders.
- What's the matter with you, miss?

378
00:29:42,203 --> 00:29:44,860
Just a moment, just a moment,
I'll be right back.

379
00:30:00,997 --> 00:30:03,867
Here's the box reservation.
Still writing?

380
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:06,743
- What is it, the note?
- Yeah.

381
00:30:07,156 --> 00:30:11,380
I won't be disturbed if you pay
me a visit in my dressing room.

382
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:28,249
Get out and wait for me
in the bar.

383
00:31:28,253 --> 00:31:30,143
- Like that, Ivón?
- You can't be here.

384
00:31:30,145 --> 00:31:33,426
I'll get the clothes to get
dressed in any other place.

385
00:31:34,057 --> 00:31:36,086
Who do you think I am?

386
00:31:37,038 --> 00:31:39,041
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

387
00:31:50,927 --> 00:31:52,778
Come in.

388
00:31:55,501 --> 00:31:58,646
What's up? I've been this morning
to the publisher.

389
00:31:59,047 --> 00:32:01,285
- Why are you coming at these hours?
- Which ones?

390
00:32:01,287 --> 00:32:03,448
These ones.
At the evening show.

391
00:32:03,655 --> 00:32:07,881
It's been spoilt. I was nearby.
Besides, I wanna tell you something.

392
00:32:07,883 --> 00:32:11,181
I was thinking, I wanna go to Barcelona
and try the local publishers.

393
00:32:12,229 --> 00:32:14,907
What's the matter with you?
Aren't you glad I came?

394
00:32:15,168 --> 00:32:16,702
Sure, sure.

395
00:32:16,712 --> 00:32:19,254
- What do you think?
- Very good.

396
00:32:19,439 --> 00:32:20,901
I'm leaving tonight.

397
00:32:20,904 --> 00:32:23,384
Listen, Hugo, why don't you wait
for me in the bar while I get dressed?

398
00:32:23,405 --> 00:32:25,789
Don't you have a screen?
Do you know my novel's flaw...

399
00:32:25,792 --> 00:32:27,166
...according to the publisher?

400
00:32:27,168 --> 00:32:30,953
It's not human, it's not realistic.
Always the same.

401
00:32:31,006 --> 00:32:33,858
- Why don't you get out?
- I've got too much imagination, Ivón.

402
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:37,827
- Don't open the door!
- There's no rehearsal tomorrow, Miss Ivón.

403
00:32:38,008 --> 00:32:39,476
Oh, fine.

404
00:32:39,676 --> 00:32:42,705
- What were you saying about imagination?
- Just that.

405
00:32:42,931 --> 00:32:46,201
Imagination is a flaw for
writers nowadays.

406
00:32:46,204 --> 00:32:48,224
Please, wait for me
in the bar, Hugo.

407
00:32:48,412 --> 00:32:51,776
- You don't care about my problems, do you?
- Yes, but I don't understand them.

408
00:32:51,778 --> 00:32:53,524
Solve them for yourself. Don't
you have a lot of imagination?

409
00:32:53,527 --> 00:32:56,191
You too? You're getting
tired of me.

410
00:32:56,193 --> 00:32:58,365
Don't you see I'm working for us,
so we can get married...

411
00:32:58,367 --> 00:33:01,380
...and you can leave this pigsty?
- Leave me alone! You're hurting me.

412
00:33:01,566 --> 00:33:03,760
- Miss Ivón's dressing room?
- This door.

413
00:33:03,967 --> 00:33:06,554
I'm going to Barcelona. Talking
with you is useless.

414
00:33:06,557 --> 00:33:09,306
Don't go now, wait.

415
00:33:09,309 --> 00:33:10,865
Don't you hear it?

416
00:33:15,041 --> 00:33:16,656
Miss Ivón?

417
00:33:21,043 --> 00:33:22,596
What are you saying?

418
00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:27,943
- Miss Ivón?
- Yes, that's me.

419
00:33:29,906 --> 00:33:32,302
Here, from "Flores La Camelia."

420
00:33:34,403 --> 00:33:37,252
What a bouquet!
Tremendous!

421
00:33:37,690 --> 00:33:40,025
Thanks, thank you very much.

422
00:33:40,254 --> 00:33:42,526
- Who sent it?
- Sorry, I almost forgot.

423
00:33:42,724 --> 00:33:43,855
Give it to me!

424
00:33:43,909 --> 00:33:45,409
Let's see who's your admirer.

425
00:33:45,419 --> 00:33:47,106
- Give it to me!
- Let me open it.

426
00:33:47,116 --> 00:33:48,768
Give me that right now.
It's mine.

427
00:33:49,931 --> 00:33:51,958
What the hell is wrong
with you this evening?

428
00:33:52,162 --> 00:33:54,687
Why don't you want me to read it?
Do you think I care about...

429
00:33:54,689 --> 00:33:56,680
...dummies who spend their
money buying flowers?

430
00:34:07,748 --> 00:34:10,819
I forgot to tell you: I
sent those flowers.

431
00:34:10,829 --> 00:34:14,373
I was down due to the publisher's
denial and I thought it'd help you...

432
00:34:14,374 --> 00:34:16,335
...to bear the bad news.

433
00:34:17,505 --> 00:34:22,382
The note says: "I always
love you, Hugo."

434
00:34:33,351 --> 00:34:36,500
I won't be disturbed if you pay me
a visit in my dressing room. Ivón.

435
00:34:47,635 --> 00:34:49,485
Why has Hugo come?

436
00:34:49,683 --> 00:34:52,383
The other one must have
seen him and got away.

437
00:34:52,565 --> 00:34:53,965
You must phone him.

438
00:34:54,387 --> 00:34:56,362
You know his telephone number,
don't you?

439
00:34:56,559 --> 00:34:59,603
Apologize to him, tell him
Hugo is a relative of yours.

440
00:34:59,648 --> 00:35:01,640
Hugo is his father.

441
00:35:01,645 --> 00:35:03,611
- His father?
- Yeah, his father.

442
00:35:11,006 --> 00:35:14,708
Good night, Mr. Pascal. A man
came asking for you.

443
00:35:14,718 --> 00:35:16,700
He came three times. He said
it was very urgent.

444
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:19,200
- Did he tell you who he was?
- He left his card.

445
00:35:19,204 --> 00:35:22,333
He said you should go see him,
or telephone him.

446
00:35:23,846 --> 00:35:27,568
- Allright, thanks, Gregorio.
- You're welcome, Mr. Pascal.

447
00:35:54,158 --> 00:35:56,000
SALVADOR CASTRO
LAWYER

448
00:36:01,929 --> 00:36:04,656
- Hello?
- Is that you, Carlos?

449
00:36:04,851 --> 00:36:10,936
No, no. I'm not her, I'm a friend,
her close friend. She's here...

450
00:36:10,938 --> 00:36:13,848
...by my side. She'll take the phone.
She's signaling to give her...

451
00:36:13,849 --> 00:36:15,972
...the phone.
She'll take it right away.

452
00:36:16,004 --> 00:36:18,801
- I don't want to. Hang up.
- Come on, he's waiting.

453
00:36:18,856 --> 00:36:20,549
Tell him you can meet someplace.

454
00:36:20,559 --> 00:36:23,138
- I said I don't want to!
- Are you dumb, girl?

455
00:36:23,508 --> 00:36:29,329
She'll be here right away, she's coming.
Goodbye, Carlos, pleased to meet you.

456
00:36:29,527 --> 00:36:30,770
That's enough.

457
00:36:30,956 --> 00:36:33,045
Excuse me, please,
I understand you.

458
00:36:33,347 --> 00:36:35,535
I was also surprised to see
your father at that hour.

459
00:36:37,845 --> 00:36:41,045
Excuse me, please,
I understand you.

460
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,747
I was also surprised to see
your father at that hour.

461
00:36:44,141 --> 00:36:46,464
He came to tell me he's going to
Barcelona tonight.

462
00:36:46,669 --> 00:36:48,617
And that's why I dared
to phone you.

463
00:36:48,799 --> 00:36:52,508
And that's why I dared to phone you.
I know he's in the station.

464
00:36:52,925 --> 00:36:55,197
You were expecting me to phone you,
weren't you?

465
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:59,957
Please, Carlos, don't misunderstand me.
I can't betray your father...

466
00:37:00,385 --> 00:37:03,006
...but I can't betray
myself either.

467
00:37:03,239 --> 00:37:06,097
That's the same way
you feel, isn't it?

468
00:37:06,099 --> 00:37:09,001
One doesn't know what love is
until it suddenly arises.

469
00:37:09,395 --> 00:37:14,343
One doesn't know what love is
until it suddenly arises.

470
00:37:15,202 --> 00:37:18,577
Listen, let's talk.

471
00:37:19,476 --> 00:37:22,369
I'll be waiting for you tonight
at the end of the show.

472
00:37:22,764 --> 00:37:24,505
- What did he say?
- Not even a word.

473
00:37:24,515 --> 00:37:26,477
He must be shaking like jelly.

474
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,556
One doesn't know what love is
until it suddenly arises.

475
00:37:49,429 --> 00:37:52,990
One doesn't know what love is
until it suddenly arises.

476
00:37:53,396 --> 00:37:57,083
Don't you hear it?
Open the door.

477
00:38:00,204 --> 00:38:01,485
Wait.

478
00:38:14,469 --> 00:38:17,403
I'm sorry, I don't wanna bother you
but I gotta finish my report.

479
00:38:17,836 --> 00:38:19,423
It'll just be a moment.

480
00:38:21,741 --> 00:38:26,263
- What was your son wearing?
- Well, he was wearing a raincoat.

481
00:38:26,933 --> 00:38:30,269
And a grey suit underneath.
I'm not quite sure.

482
00:38:30,493 --> 00:38:32,865
Are you sure it was an accident?

483
00:38:34,081 --> 00:38:37,285
I mean, was there anything
wrong with the boy?

484
00:38:37,516 --> 00:38:40,685
Any intimate annoyance that could
have led him to take that decision.

485
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:43,667
Suicide?
Good Heavens, don't speak nonsense.

486
00:38:43,882 --> 00:38:46,156
Carlos was a normal kid.

487
00:38:46,359 --> 00:38:48,957
Sometimes there are problems
parents don't know.

488
00:38:48,959 --> 00:38:51,343
I beg you not to get things
out of proportion.

489
00:38:52,277 --> 00:38:54,142
Well, that's all.

490
00:38:54,287 --> 00:38:56,518
If there's anything new
we'll let you know.

491
00:38:56,528 --> 00:38:57,556
Thank you.

492
00:38:57,559 --> 00:38:59,696
Oh, you'll have to stay here
for a few days.

493
00:38:59,699 --> 00:39:01,857
- What?
- Maybe a week.

494
00:39:01,858 --> 00:39:03,661
Think about it, there are some
formalities that must be done.

495
00:39:03,663 --> 00:39:06,923
Think about it? What the hell should I
think about and what have I to do...

496
00:39:06,925 --> 00:39:09,945
...with your profession? Besides all
my pain, I have to stay here.

497
00:39:10,108 --> 00:39:12,088
Can't you see I can't bear it
any longer?

498
00:39:12,239 --> 00:39:13,000
I understand you, but...

499
00:39:13,003 --> 00:39:15,004
If you have to do any formality
just go ahead and do it.

500
00:39:15,014 --> 00:39:17,857
But leave me alone. We're going
to Madrid right now.

501
00:39:17,925 --> 00:39:19,098
You can't do that.

502
00:39:20,356 --> 00:39:23,651
I tell you once more you can't
leave for a few days.

503
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:33,572
Why did you get angry?

504
00:39:33,961 --> 00:39:38,441
Why do you wanna leave?
We're very confortable here.

505
00:39:59,803 --> 00:40:01,701
- Mr. Commissioner!
- What's the matter?

506
00:40:01,802 --> 00:40:04,453
- An urgent call from Madrid.
- From headquarters?

507
00:40:04,455 --> 00:40:05,989
I don't know, they only said
it was very urgent.

508
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,207
Well, let's go.

509
00:40:08,902 --> 00:40:11,200
They've called three times,
Mr. Jesus, they seem very angry.

510
00:40:11,209 --> 00:40:14,198
- Isn't it from headquarters?
- No, sir, it's a lawyer from Madrid.

511
00:40:14,374 --> 00:40:17,392
Hello? Yeah, Commissioner
speaking.
Talk to me.

512
00:40:17,545 --> 00:40:21,053
Will you please tell me in which
hotel Mr. Hugo Pascal is lodged?

513
00:40:21,207 --> 00:40:24,908
And please, what has happened?
Any news about that terrible accident?

514
00:40:25,077 --> 00:40:29,494
- The paper is very clear.
- There's nothing more to know.

515
00:40:29,654 --> 00:40:31,979
We're trying to find the body
but it's very difficult.

516
00:40:32,342 --> 00:40:34,905
Excuse me, will you please tell me
with whom I'm talking to?

517
00:40:35,111 --> 00:40:38,148
Write down Mr. Salvador
Castro, lawyer.

518
00:40:38,951 --> 00:40:40,036
Are you a relative?

519
00:40:40,039 --> 00:40:42,691
I'm the executor of Mr. Pascal's
late aunt's estate.

520
00:40:42,694 --> 00:40:46,096
I'm shocked, she died 5 days ago
and now the boy.

521
00:40:46,265 --> 00:40:48,716
It's terrible, he was about
to inherit.

522
00:40:48,717 --> 00:40:51,716
Well, will you please tell me
in which hotel he's lodged?

523
00:40:51,808 --> 00:40:55,996
At the Savoy, 2201.
Does Mr. Pascal have more sons?

524
00:40:56,576 --> 00:40:58,347
Good.
You're welcome, Sir.

525
00:40:58,787 --> 00:41:02,742
Poor boy, he was the only son.
And very bad luck, he dies...

526
00:41:02,745 --> 00:41:04,105
...when he was about to inherit.

527
00:41:04,115 --> 00:41:06,173
I have always said money
brings bad luck.

528
00:41:06,175 --> 00:41:09,830
Mr. Jesus, don't you think we should
listen to that telephone call?

529
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:12,396
- Why?
- I don't know, don't listen to me...

530
00:41:12,399 --> 00:41:14,236
...but when money is in the middle...

531
00:41:14,239 --> 00:41:16,765
The son was about to inherit
and dies in strange circumstances...

532
00:41:16,768 --> 00:41:18,599
...and now the money goes
straight to his father.

533
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:21,255
In strange circumstances?
Going to see the sea and slips isn't...

534
00:41:21,257 --> 00:41:22,543
Don't you think it's strange?

535
00:41:22,546 --> 00:41:25,036
Going to see the sea at night
with that horrible storm.

536
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,436
It isn't logical.

537
00:41:26,438 --> 00:41:28,000
What are you thinking of?

538
00:41:28,001 --> 00:41:31,133
Instead of slipping it could
have been...

539
00:41:33,904 --> 00:41:36,351
- What are you basing that on?
- On nothing.

540
00:41:36,548 --> 00:41:39,431
It could have been done better
than that if they'd wanted to.

541
00:41:39,503 --> 00:41:41,735
- I know it makes no sense.
- To get the son's inheritance?

542
00:41:41,737 --> 00:41:43,982
Do you think everybody that
inherits is an assassin?

543
00:41:43,985 --> 00:41:46,869
Hey, my aunt Jacinta is ill and she's
gonna give me an amount of money.

544
00:41:50,092 --> 00:41:52,623
If I were you I'd listen
to that telephone call.

545
00:41:54,415 --> 00:41:55,638
Hello.

546
00:41:57,896 --> 00:41:59,293
Just a moment.

547
00:42:00,565 --> 00:42:02,469
A phone call from Madrid.

548
00:42:05,678 --> 00:42:06,883
Who's speaking?

549
00:42:07,511 --> 00:42:09,179
Oh, tell me, tell me.

550
00:42:09,183 --> 00:42:11,925
I'm sorry about the events, Mr. Pascal.
I don't wanna ask you about...

551
00:42:11,929 --> 00:42:14,173
... the reasons for this
journey, you can do...

552
00:42:14,175 --> 00:42:16,229
...whatever you want, but why did
you take your son with you?

553
00:42:16,232 --> 00:42:18,708
Don't you know I must open your aunt's
will the day after tomorrow...

554
00:42:18,709 --> 00:42:20,967
...and your son needs to be there?

555
00:42:21,388 --> 00:42:25,544
You're wrong if you think I'm
gonna listen to this nonsense.

556
00:42:25,745 --> 00:42:28,988
I came here because I wanted to, and I
took my son with me for the same reason.

557
00:42:29,170 --> 00:42:31,327
Do you want anything else?

558
00:42:31,329 --> 00:42:35,201
Just to remind you that the day after
tomorrow I must open the will...

559
00:42:35,205 --> 00:42:38,318
...and now you are the only heir,
as you should know.

560
00:42:38,526 --> 00:42:42,179
If your aunt were still alive
I don't think she would like to see...

561
00:42:42,184 --> 00:42:44,398
...you win in the end.

562
00:42:55,122 --> 00:42:56,587
ACCIDENT OR SUICIDE?

563
00:42:56,588 --> 00:42:59,221
Son of writer Hugo Pascal falls to
the sea from Cimadevilla cliffs.

564
00:42:59,222 --> 00:43:00,676
The corpse hasn't been found.

565
00:43:12,403 --> 00:43:14,568
You're right, it's a rented one.

566
00:43:35,141 --> 00:43:37,335
- Good night, gentlemen.
- Come on, don't be a joker.

567
00:43:37,517 --> 00:43:41,367
- Are they still up?
- People from Madrid stay up late.

568
00:43:41,533 --> 00:43:43,500
They're in the first-floor hall.

569
00:43:43,502 --> 00:43:45,839
When they came last night, it was
about this hour, wasn't it?

570
00:43:46,299 --> 00:43:49,077
Exactly the same. My shift
starts at a quarter to one.

571
00:43:49,078 --> 00:43:51,999
Listen, I've read in the paper
that you said...

572
00:43:52,216 --> 00:43:54,905
...he asked you to accompany them
to the promontory...

573
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,493
...to show them the way.

574
00:43:56,494 --> 00:43:59,785
Yes, Sir. They told me:
"Come on, come with us"

575
00:43:59,787 --> 00:44:02,567
- Are you sure that's what they told you?
- Well...

576
00:44:02,979 --> 00:44:06,400
You see, I've tried to make it
more thrilling.

577
00:44:06,403 --> 00:44:10,131
- Did they tell you that or not?
- No. But they could have told me that.

578
00:44:10,309 --> 00:44:11,455
I...

579
00:44:11,507 --> 00:44:14,159
That was impossible, boss,
they didn't want any witnesses.

580
00:44:14,336 --> 00:44:17,316
In the paper you say that the boy seemed
to have a premonition of his death...

581
00:44:17,697 --> 00:44:19,985
...and that he shook hands with you
with tears in his eyes.

582
00:44:20,196 --> 00:44:24,119
I said that to make it more thrilling.
Just to make it more thrilling.

583
00:44:24,122 --> 00:44:26,497
- Are you dumb?
- Not at all, Mr. Commissioner.

584
00:44:26,679 --> 00:44:31,551
I'm just an entertaining man.
I have always hated dull stories.

585
00:44:31,742 --> 00:44:35,923
The sudden entrance of the boy
must also be for thrills.

586
00:44:36,311 --> 00:44:38,796
- The sticking of the pen and...
- No, no, Sir.

587
00:44:39,007 --> 00:44:41,279
You can see the pierced paper.

588
00:44:43,081 --> 00:44:45,805
Do you see the mark?
Then I got angry...

589
00:44:46,037 --> 00:44:48,725
...as I used to get angry when
customers would stick the pen...

590
00:44:48,728 --> 00:44:51,159
- ...in the counter.
- Do they stick the pen in the counter?

591
00:44:51,345 --> 00:44:54,348
- And I told the boy: "Hey, boy..."
- But you didn't see him.

592
00:44:54,527 --> 00:44:57,348
You said that when you got down
he was inside the elevator.

593
00:44:57,557 --> 00:44:58,601
You're right.

594
00:44:58,603 --> 00:45:00,129
If you continue being
entertaining, I'm gonna...

595
00:45:00,499 --> 00:45:04,054
Alright. He got inside the elevator
and went up to his flat.

596
00:45:04,057 --> 00:45:06,031
- Which floor?
- Which one could it be?

597
00:45:06,196 --> 00:45:08,453
The floor, of course, the second.

598
00:45:08,657 --> 00:45:10,936
Who told him to go up
to the second floor?

599
00:45:11,796 --> 00:45:13,760
If you didn't tell him and
neither did the waitress...

600
00:45:13,762 --> 00:45:16,020
...how did he know the
number of the floor?

601
00:45:17,499 --> 00:45:19,770
I swear nobody told him that.

602
00:45:19,772 --> 00:45:22,836
So he guessed the floor.
And the number of the room...

603
00:45:23,021 --> 00:45:26,000
...'cos there are more than one.
- Fifteen.

604
00:45:26,002 --> 00:45:27,494
Yeah, it's strange.

605
00:45:27,495 --> 00:45:29,182
Maybe he heard it.

606
00:45:30,865 --> 00:45:32,658
With the door closed?

607
00:45:37,806 --> 00:45:39,610
Please, say something.

608
00:45:58,300 --> 00:46:00,248
I was telling him I'm not sure
of having...

609
00:46:00,249 --> 00:46:02,063
Is this door as it was yesterday?

610
00:46:02,066 --> 00:46:03,300
The same way.

611
00:46:03,346 --> 00:46:05,570
Was it without the doorhandle?

612
00:46:05,732 --> 00:46:08,737
I take it off every night
when I start my shift, so...

613
00:46:08,739 --> 00:46:12,200
...I can sleep peacefully. If anybody
wants to come in he must ring the bell.

614
00:46:12,376 --> 00:46:14,733
Then, where did the boy come in from?

615
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:17,086
If this man was upstairs,
who opened the door?

616
00:46:17,164 --> 00:46:19,809
If nobody opened the door, did he
filter through the glass?

617
00:46:19,819 --> 00:46:21,480
Maybe it was opened.

618
00:46:45,721 --> 00:46:47,441
Hello?

619
00:46:47,647 --> 00:46:50,669
Yes, sir, it's ready.
I'll take it right away.

620
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:54,224
It's them.

621
00:46:55,895 --> 00:46:58,423
The coffee for Mr. Pascal!

622
00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:02,147
I admit there's something
strange here.

623
00:47:02,447 --> 00:47:05,327
Maybe we should go and ask them
about it, they may have...

624
00:47:05,337 --> 00:47:07,922
...an explanation.
- Everything was phony.

625
00:47:07,932 --> 00:47:11,803
They brought him here dead. They made
everybody believe he was alive...

626
00:47:11,808 --> 00:47:14,370
...so the accident could be
justified.

627
00:47:15,403 --> 00:47:19,717
What they threw from the promontory
was a corpse.

628
00:47:36,721 --> 00:47:39,810
- They must've killed him in Madrid.
- Where did they bring him?

629
00:47:39,811 --> 00:47:43,260
- How did they get him in here?
- Think of that big suitcase.

630
00:47:43,429 --> 00:47:45,730
The caretaker says it was
very heavy...

631
00:47:59,846 --> 00:48:01,987
Half past one, how awful!

632
00:48:02,172 --> 00:48:04,692
In Madrid everything starts
at these hours.

633
00:48:05,097 --> 00:48:08,846
The curtain must be falling now.
Don't worry, I'll serve it.

634
00:48:09,465 --> 00:48:12,928
And you, arriving in the
dressing room to pick me up.

635
00:48:13,722 --> 00:48:15,780
I'm willing to come back to Madrid.

636
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:28,431
One doesn't know what love is
until it suddenly arises.

637
00:48:30,308 --> 00:48:34,758
I'd like to talk with you. I'll be
waiting for you at the end of the show.

638
00:48:35,309 --> 00:48:37,470
I'll be waiting for you tonight
at the end of the show.

639
00:48:37,817 --> 00:48:39,945
I'll be waiting for you tonight
at the end of the show.

640
00:49:38,006 --> 00:49:39,940
Mr. Pascal is late, isn't he?

641
00:49:39,947 --> 00:49:42,945
No, he's not in Madrid, he has
left for Barcelona.

642
00:49:45,007 --> 00:49:46,009
Are you staying?

643
00:49:46,121 --> 00:49:48,413
- Goodbye, Mr. Manolo.
- Good night, Miss.

644
00:50:09,221 --> 00:50:11,985
- What are you doing here?
- Just looking at you.

645
00:50:11,989 --> 00:50:15,017
- Hadn't you left for Barcelona?
- Where did you come from?

646
00:50:15,188 --> 00:50:16,773
From the theatre.

647
00:50:20,451 --> 00:50:24,240
They've been reading a play.
Maybe we won't go into liquidation.

648
00:50:24,883 --> 00:50:27,205
Why did you tell me you were
going to Barcelona?

649
00:50:27,215 --> 00:50:30,323
I'm leaving tomorrow.
There were no tickets left.

650
00:50:30,489 --> 00:50:34,082
Then, why didn't you come to
the theatre as usual?

651
00:50:34,930 --> 00:50:38,800
Carlos suddenly got ill.

652
00:50:38,807 --> 00:50:40,461
Give me a cigarette.

653
00:50:40,521 --> 00:50:42,312
Suddenly? How strange.

654
00:50:42,313 --> 00:50:44,459
- Will you please look in your handbag?
- Yeah, yeah.

655
00:50:44,462 --> 00:50:47,613
There must be one or two left.
So you've been at home.

656
00:50:47,797 --> 00:50:50,125
Poor man, and I was thinking
bad things.

657
00:50:50,297 --> 00:50:53,300
- Bad things about whom?
- About you, silly.

658
00:50:53,317 --> 00:50:55,753
I thought you'd left for Barcelona
without waving me goodbye.

659
00:50:55,763 --> 00:50:57,691
You know this evening you
didn't wave me goodbye.

660
00:50:58,320 --> 00:51:02,841
Hey, I love you spite of all,
do you hear? I love you.

661
00:51:03,025 --> 00:51:05,472
Don't force me to do something
I don't want to.

662
00:51:05,475 --> 00:51:07,829
- But if you insist, I will.
- What's the matter with you?

663
00:51:09,391 --> 00:51:12,417
I want us to get married right away.
With the money you earn...

664
00:51:12,419 --> 00:51:15,028
...and the pension the
bank pays me...

665
00:51:15,662 --> 00:51:19,710
- Pension? The bank?
- Where do you think I get money from?

666
00:51:19,917 --> 00:51:22,189
From the interest payments
on my son's capital.

667
00:51:21,899 --> 00:51:23,452
You cash them.

668
00:51:23,506 --> 00:51:26,495
I feed him and pay for his
career.
That's how I make a living.

669
00:51:26,497 --> 00:51:29,480
That's another way aunt Angela
found to embarrass me.

670
00:51:30,517 --> 00:51:33,278
It's a small amount, you know?
But the three of us could live.

671
00:51:33,309 --> 00:51:35,859
What do you think?
15 days more and we'll get married.

672
00:51:35,913 --> 00:51:38,930
- I'll have to keep on working, won't I?
- Well, just for the moment.

673
00:51:38,933 --> 00:51:42,603
- What does for the moment mean?
- Until my first novel is published.

674
00:51:42,613 --> 00:51:45,215
- Come on, leave me alone.
- You don't believe in me, do you?

675
00:51:45,363 --> 00:51:47,689
You don't care about me because
I can't give you any money.

676
00:51:47,692 --> 00:51:50,605
That's the only thing you care about,
millions. You don't care if I'm dumb.

677
00:51:50,615 --> 00:51:52,671
'Cos everyone who has millions
is a dumb one.

678
00:51:52,709 --> 00:51:54,618
You're lying and you know it.

679
00:51:54,636 --> 00:51:56,562
- Carlos is...
- Carlos is a dummy.

680
00:51:56,565 --> 00:51:58,708
What's the matter with you?
You're jealous.

681
00:51:58,711 --> 00:52:00,214
You should be ashamed,
talking like that...

682
00:52:00,217 --> 00:52:02,546
...when you're living
at his expense.

683
00:53:58,896 --> 00:54:01,316
- Good morning, may I come in?
- Ah, hello. Come in.

684
00:54:01,950 --> 00:54:04,412
- You get up early, don't you?
- It is only work.

685
00:54:04,506 --> 00:54:06,812
I'm not used to going to
my clients' houses...

686
00:54:06,815 --> 00:54:09,470
...but it seems it's the only
way to find you at home.

687
00:54:09,624 --> 00:54:11,774
Didn't the caretaker tell you
I came three times?

688
00:54:11,779 --> 00:54:13,830
- Yes, he gave me your card.
- Why didn't you phone me?

689
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:16,456
Look, Mr. Castro, I'm not your
client.
That's my aunt.

690
00:54:16,459 --> 00:54:19,059
I only care about people I like,
and you and my aunt...

691
00:54:19,060 --> 00:54:22,030
...are none of those.
Will you tell me what do you want?

692
00:54:22,031 --> 00:54:24,588
Your aunt is dying. She wants
to talk with your son.

693
00:54:27,092 --> 00:54:30,603
She is dying? I didn't even
know she was ill.

694
00:54:30,605 --> 00:54:33,100
It's not that. She is very old.

695
00:54:33,681 --> 00:54:37,188
- May I talk with Mr. Carlos?
- Come in. Please, come in.

696
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,989
- Poor aunt Angela.
- She wants to see him.

697
00:54:41,164 --> 00:54:43,344
- Does she wanna see me?
- She wants no part of you.

698
00:54:43,349 --> 00:54:46,744
She wants to see your son.
Is he
at home? I've gotta talk with him.

699
00:54:46,890 --> 00:54:48,566
No, he's not at home.

700
00:54:48,741 --> 00:54:50,814
I heard him leaving very early.

701
00:54:52,268 --> 00:54:54,180
Are you sure she doesn't want
to see me?

702
00:54:54,774 --> 00:54:57,197
- It's impossible.
- Why?

703
00:54:57,957 --> 00:55:02,088
I don't understand why she
doesn't remember me.

704
00:55:02,098 --> 00:55:04,802
She remembers everything,
she's got a good memory.

705
00:55:05,608 --> 00:55:07,326
- Have you talked with her?
- Yeah.

706
00:55:08,572 --> 00:55:10,361
- Did you talk about me?
- God forbid!

707
00:55:10,401 --> 00:55:12,847
She wants to say goodbye
to your son, so please...

708
00:55:12,849 --> 00:55:16,116
...tell him that. He must leave now
or he won't arrive on time.

709
00:56:11,564 --> 00:56:13,215
Carlos!

710
00:56:18,460 --> 00:56:20,392
You?

711
00:56:24,585 --> 00:56:28,254
Carlos couldn't come.
He has a lot of work to do.

712
00:56:29,877 --> 00:56:32,446
How are you, aunt Angela?
- You're lying.

713
00:56:32,874 --> 00:56:37,077
You haven't wanted him to come.
You have never let him come.

714
00:56:37,622 --> 00:56:41,436
And I know why.
Get out! Go away.

715
00:56:41,636 --> 00:56:45,486
No, I want you to forgive me.
It all happened a long time ago.

716
00:56:45,632 --> 00:56:47,459
- Go away, send me your son.
- Listen to me.

717
00:56:47,469 --> 00:56:48,951
Get out, Hugo.

718
00:56:48,955 --> 00:56:52,062
Please, you can't remember that.

719
00:56:52,276 --> 00:56:55,335
It was 19 years ago,
don't you understand?

720
00:56:56,111 --> 00:57:00,160
I would be lying if I said I
forgive you. You hurted me so much...

721
00:57:07,708 --> 00:57:09,897
Do you remember the day
I said it to you?

722
00:57:11,304 --> 00:57:14,545
You had just told me you wouldn't
give me any more money.

723
00:57:15,532 --> 00:57:17,375
I was desperate.

724
00:57:18,296 --> 00:57:20,907
I wasn't born to work,
the way you wanted me to.

725
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:24,086
I was born...

726
00:57:24,932 --> 00:57:28,528
...for writing.
For making up stories.

727
00:57:28,921 --> 00:57:31,605
For releasing all the
fantasy I had inside.

728
00:57:31,615 --> 00:57:35,135
You never had
fantasy, but vanity.

729
00:57:35,518 --> 00:57:40,156
It's true. I've got vanity
and I've got fantasy.

730
00:57:40,159 --> 00:57:44,011
No, if you had fantasy you wouldn't
have a baby in that mean way...

731
00:57:44,017 --> 00:57:45,538
...so miserable.

732
00:57:48,442 --> 00:57:53,707
My son doesn't exist, aunt Angela.

733
00:57:55,325 --> 00:57:57,160
He has never existed.

734
00:57:57,379 --> 00:58:00,031
He's a son of my
fantasy,
of my vanity.

735
00:58:00,237 --> 00:58:02,947
I wanted to prove to you
that I had imagination.

736
00:58:03,147 --> 00:58:07,305
I had to create him to live,
to keep on fighting.

737
00:58:07,517 --> 00:58:10,851
I was sure you won't refuse
to give him money to live.

738
00:58:11,491 --> 00:58:14,134
And I will live with that money.

739
00:58:15,931 --> 00:58:19,657
When I came back to Madrid I went
to the court and lied to them.

740
00:58:19,876 --> 00:58:23,237
They never check. That was
the document I sent to you.

741
00:58:24,533 --> 00:58:28,261
At the beginning it was just a game,
it was to create a character...

742
00:58:28,263 --> 00:58:33,155
...and make him live on the paper.
To give him a personality...

743
00:58:33,159 --> 00:58:37,371
...and change it as he was growing up.
With his infatuations and caprices.

744
00:58:38,161 --> 00:58:41,055
It was also funny to make him up
in the physical sense.

745
00:58:42,703 --> 00:58:46,631
I gave him the color of your eyes,
aunt, I have always liked it.

746
00:58:46,709 --> 00:58:49,919
That's a lie. You're denying him
to be forgiven.

747
00:58:49,922 --> 00:58:52,001
- I've lived 19 years with him.
- You're lying.

748
00:58:52,004 --> 00:58:55,571
He's been my pride. No writer ever
created a character more human.

749
00:58:55,963 --> 00:58:58,965
I have lived with him, I've seen him
and I've touched him.

750
00:59:00,857 --> 00:59:03,909
And I've loved him like a son.

751
00:59:05,129 --> 00:59:06,807
And he has loved me.

752
00:59:11,700 --> 00:59:15,559
Sorry, aunt, I think I'm
gonna go crazy.

753
00:59:15,973 --> 00:59:19,425
What about the letters and the presents?
And those postcards he sent me...

754
00:59:19,429 --> 00:59:22,987
...from Rome, with
such dedications...?

755
00:59:22,989 --> 00:59:25,686
It isn't possible.
You're lying.

756
00:59:26,067 --> 00:59:29,855
One New Year's Eve he sent me a
present and you didn't know it.

757
00:59:30,447 --> 00:59:33,676
It was bought in Rome by the same
friend who sent you the postcards.

758
00:59:36,712 --> 00:59:40,387
What about that illness he suffered?
You asked me for money for medicine.

759
00:59:40,389 --> 00:59:43,710
I needed money to go to Barcelona.
I also needed money when...

760
00:59:43,716 --> 00:59:47,057
...I asked you for toys and books,
and for the school fee.

761
00:59:47,100 --> 00:59:49,500
I've never asked you for any
more money than I needed.

762
00:59:49,501 --> 00:59:53,065
- God will punish you, Hugo.
- He's already punishing me.

763
00:59:53,838 --> 00:59:56,159
My son is turning against me.

764
00:59:56,683 --> 00:59:59,700
The woman I'm gonna marry
wants to cheat on me with him.

765
00:59:59,705 --> 01:00:02,013
I have no money and he's rich.

766
01:00:02,018 --> 01:00:04,105
Are you nuts? Tell her
he doesn't exist.

767
01:00:04,115 --> 01:00:06,200
What will be the use of
telling her the truth?

768
01:00:06,210 --> 01:00:08,960
What will be the use of telling her
she has fallen in love with a shadow?

769
01:00:09,349 --> 01:00:14,586
No. She must return to me just for me.
Not because the other doesn't exist.

770
01:00:14,977 --> 01:00:18,403
I must convince her I'm better
than him, much better.

771
01:00:18,413 --> 01:00:20,538
I am a writer.

772
01:00:22,189 --> 01:00:26,025
I must triumph.
I swear I'll triumph.

773
01:00:27,134 --> 01:00:29,120
I'll fight against my son.

774
01:00:29,774 --> 01:00:31,301
I will defeat him.

775
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:37,919
- I must defeat him.
- Hugo, come here, don't go.

776
01:01:15,605 --> 01:01:18,976
Phone him again. He'll answer
sooner or later.

777
01:01:18,978 --> 01:01:21,300
He won't. I'm sure he doesn't
answer because...

778
01:01:21,303 --> 01:01:23,656
...he knows it's me. He must be
waiting for me to go to his house...

779
01:01:23,659 --> 01:01:24,680
...begging on my knees.

780
01:01:24,685 --> 01:01:27,318
- That way everything will be fixed.
- Begging on my knees?

781
01:01:27,910 --> 01:01:29,454
That's what you think.

782
01:01:31,208 --> 01:01:34,119
- You should go to his house.
- Thank you very much.

783
01:01:35,206 --> 01:01:38,097
Hey, give me back the sandwich.
It was a salami one.

784
01:01:38,099 --> 01:01:39,306
Right away.

785
01:01:40,708 --> 01:01:43,212
You can do what you want, but
I would do my best now that...

786
01:01:43,214 --> 01:01:45,756
...Hugo is journeying.
Do you
know what happens to that boy?

787
01:01:45,906 --> 01:01:48,288
He doesn't dare to come close
while his father is around.

788
01:01:48,444 --> 01:01:50,300
Listen, leave his father alone.

789
01:01:50,695 --> 01:01:53,886
Have a quarrel with him, that way
everything will be fixed.

790
01:01:54,308 --> 01:01:56,643
It must be hard to take
your father's fiancé away.

791
01:01:56,849 --> 01:02:00,283
- I can't quit Hugo.
- Are you gonna marry both?

792
01:02:00,413 --> 01:02:03,060
No, of course not.
But I love Hugo.

793
01:02:03,587 --> 01:02:07,150
I swear I love him.
I don't know how to quit him.

794
01:02:07,367 --> 01:02:10,102
You're doing fine, you've got
to follow...

795
01:02:10,105 --> 01:02:11,484
...your heart's impulses.

796
01:02:11,487 --> 01:02:13,492
- Will you give me his telephone number?
- What for?

797
01:02:13,652 --> 01:02:16,296
- To go out with him tonight.
- You've got a nerve, Magda.

798
01:02:16,459 --> 01:02:19,036
- There are no noble impulses for you.
- Sure...

799
01:02:19,038 --> 01:02:21,312
...my heart is asking me
for noble millions.

800
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:24,549
Listen, why don't you
make Hugo leave you?

801
01:02:24,551 --> 01:02:27,656
That's different, isn't it?
Your conscience would be clear.

802
01:02:27,846 --> 01:02:31,160
- Hugo won't leave me.
- Make him jealous, with his son.

803
01:02:31,208 --> 01:02:33,424
Here, wear this bracelet.

804
01:02:33,425 --> 01:02:34,764
Miss Ivón.

805
01:02:36,135 --> 01:02:39,856
- Miss Ivón, phone call.
- Who is it?

806
01:02:40,044 --> 01:02:41,676
Mr. Pascal.

807
01:02:42,330 --> 01:02:44,270
Ivón?
Hello.

808
01:02:45,109 --> 01:02:46,666
I have just arrived.

809
01:02:48,006 --> 01:02:49,900
Yes, she died.

810
01:02:51,610 --> 01:02:52,776
Thanks.

811
01:02:54,088 --> 01:02:57,837
What? Rehearsing?
You didn't go into liquidation.

812
01:02:58,410 --> 01:03:02,570
No, the "White Horse" has been
bridled again.

813
01:03:02,818 --> 01:03:06,770
Besides, there's another number,
a magician.

814
01:03:07,718 --> 01:03:13,188
Hey, do you know who I thought
it was?

815
01:03:14,348 --> 01:03:15,808
Carlitos.

816
01:03:16,256 --> 01:03:18,388
Carlos, your son.

817
01:03:18,956 --> 01:03:23,603
The other day I phoned to know
when you were coming back.

818
01:03:25,524 --> 01:03:28,012
He's very nice, isn't he?

819
01:03:28,224 --> 01:03:31,540
Very, very nice.

820
01:03:31,543 --> 01:03:36,022
- He's always been a womanizer.
- Yeah, he seems very dangerous.

821
01:03:36,227 --> 01:03:38,052
I'll have to be careful.

822
01:03:38,264 --> 01:03:41,492
Well, you'll come later, won't you?
Then, goodbye.

823
01:03:41,716 --> 01:03:45,396
Great, and this evening you'll tell
him this is your mother's bracelet.

824
01:03:45,422 --> 01:03:48,505
- My mother's bracelet?
- Yeah, he won't believe you.

825
01:04:11,207 --> 01:04:14,438
Read them again, please. Maybe
you'll like one of them.

826
01:04:14,439 --> 01:04:17,553
Don't insist on it. I don't deal
with fantastical novels.

827
01:04:17,555 --> 01:04:19,108
They're not fantastical.

828
01:04:19,109 --> 01:04:22,973
You've got too much imagination
and your characters are phantoms.

829
01:04:23,216 --> 01:04:26,270
You can't cheat the readers by making
them believe that your characters...

830
01:04:26,274 --> 01:04:29,636
...can exist. The day you create
a character and you make him...

831
01:04:29,639 --> 01:04:33,598
...so human that the readers believe it,
that day my doors will be opened...

832
01:04:33,599 --> 01:04:35,196
...to you again.

833
01:04:41,518 --> 01:04:42,684
Hello, Manolo.

834
01:04:43,134 --> 01:04:44,881
Have you seen we're not going
into liquidation?

835
01:04:44,885 --> 01:04:47,162
The "White Horse" has just
passed by.

836
01:04:47,164 --> 01:04:49,334
Has a horse passed by?

837
01:04:49,558 --> 01:04:51,986
- And with money.
- Wow!

838
01:04:55,306 --> 01:04:58,845
Hugo, congratulations, I didn't
know you had such a...

839
01:04:58,847 --> 01:05:01,915
...nice son. I was shocked,
he's terrific.

840
01:05:03,706 --> 01:05:04,808
So...

841
01:05:05,002 --> 01:05:08,337
- ...my son was here.
- Yes, in the dressing room.

842
01:05:16,174 --> 01:05:18,196
On your guard, Miss Ivón!

843
01:05:42,302 --> 01:05:44,750
Is that you?
Hello, Hugo, just a moment.

844
01:05:45,370 --> 01:05:49,426
- With whom have you been taking coffee?
- With no one. I took it all alone.

845
01:05:49,428 --> 01:05:52,120
- Two?
- Yeah, I was cold.

846
01:05:52,574 --> 01:05:55,916
- Now you smoke black tobacco.
- It must be the best boy's...

847
01:05:55,919 --> 01:05:58,403
- ...who brought us the coffees.
- Us?

848
01:05:58,568 --> 01:06:02,486
The, the coffees.
What's the matter with you?

849
01:06:02,699 --> 01:06:08,370
- What a nice new bracelet.
- New? I've had it for years...

850
01:06:08,409 --> 01:06:10,156
...it was from my mother.

851
01:06:11,626 --> 01:06:14,604
So, my son has been here,
hasn't he?

852
01:06:15,786 --> 01:06:17,687
- No.
- No?

853
01:06:17,887 --> 01:06:20,700
Oh yes, and you introduced him
to Magda.

854
01:06:20,704 --> 01:06:23,644
I...? I tell you, no.
Who has told you that nonsense?

855
01:06:23,645 --> 01:06:24,416
Magda.

856
01:06:24,426 --> 01:06:27,454
- Did you take coffe here?
- It's a lie, I swear it.

857
01:06:27,887 --> 01:06:29,671
That girl is dumb!

858
01:06:30,449 --> 01:06:33,201
Believe me, Hugo, why should
I deny it?

859
01:06:33,387 --> 01:06:37,158
She told you we were here all alone,
and that we locked the door, eh?

860
01:06:37,159 --> 01:06:39,941
- I think she's capable.
- It doesn't matter.

861
01:06:40,130 --> 01:06:42,965
She didn't tell me so much.
It's you who's saying that.

862
01:06:42,967 --> 01:06:45,950
I hate insinuations.

863
01:06:53,179 --> 01:06:55,297
- What has happened? Tell me.
- He fell into the trap.

864
01:06:55,299 --> 01:06:57,084
My mother's daughter
is very clever.

865
01:06:57,108 --> 01:06:58,540
Look out! He's coming.

866
01:07:06,842 --> 01:07:09,677
- I'm going to Barcelona tonight.
- For how long?

867
01:07:09,679 --> 01:07:11,284
Four or five days.

868
01:08:18,798 --> 01:08:22,652
Carlos, where are you, boy?

869
01:08:23,707 --> 01:08:26,880
Pretty boy, pleasant boy.

870
01:08:29,303 --> 01:08:31,042
May I come in?

871
01:08:33,866 --> 01:08:36,656
I've got to tell you
something, young boy.

872
01:08:38,324 --> 01:08:41,716
Aren't you studying?

873
01:08:41,800 --> 01:08:44,702
Sleeping instead of being
with your girlfriend?

874
01:08:44,808 --> 01:08:47,643
Your visit to the dressing room
has made you feel bad.

875
01:08:51,300 --> 01:08:55,856
To see her in those shorts
has made you feel bad.

876
01:08:57,402 --> 01:09:00,202
You rascal, I know...

877
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:06,204
...you're drunk, drunk
on coffee, aren't you?

878
01:09:08,529 --> 01:09:11,570
She has fallen in love
with you.

879
01:09:11,784 --> 01:09:14,691
It's not you but your millions!

880
01:09:17,362 --> 01:09:19,462
He's a good boy...

881
01:09:20,606 --> 01:09:23,600
...but she doesn't care at all.

882
01:09:27,501 --> 01:09:29,550
You're a little dirty...

883
01:09:30,700 --> 01:09:32,733
...but you have millions.

884
01:09:38,085 --> 01:09:39,483
Millions...

885
01:09:40,141 --> 01:09:44,261
An architect, and I am
a poor rat.

886
01:09:44,876 --> 01:09:47,621
A poor rat going crazy.

887
01:09:52,300 --> 01:09:55,445
Miss Ivón, Miss Ivón...

888
01:09:55,865 --> 01:09:59,095
...Miss Ivón, Miss Ivón...

889
01:09:59,477 --> 01:10:03,667
Miss Ivón. From a man in a taxi.

890
01:10:04,771 --> 01:10:06,465
Thanks.

891
01:10:12,709 --> 01:10:14,924
- What's the matter?
- Nothing. Eat and shut up.

892
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:27,417
My beauty, Ivón: We're gonna meet
at last, my father is going...

893
01:10:27,420 --> 01:10:31,436
...to Barcelona tonight and I'll
walk him to the station.

894
01:10:32,509 --> 01:10:36,111
Wait for me in my flat.
Carlos.

895
01:10:36,112 --> 01:10:39,055
Fantastic, there you are.
Go there right away.

896
01:10:39,247 --> 01:10:41,345
I was sure he would answer.

897
01:10:41,541 --> 01:10:44,371
I guess you won't forget
about me, will you?

898
01:10:45,583 --> 01:10:47,437
Do you think I should go?

899
01:10:47,439 --> 01:10:50,423
Ivón, don't you realize what
all of this meana?

900
01:10:52,493 --> 01:10:54,199
What do you mean?

901
01:10:55,219 --> 01:10:57,403
'Cos I know what this means.

902
01:10:57,413 --> 01:11:00,523
I'm refering to 3,226,000 pesetas.

903
01:11:00,716 --> 01:11:03,041
A big castle and a lot of
mink coats.

904
01:11:03,215 --> 01:11:05,398
You're stupid.
Come, we've gotta talk.

905
01:11:05,618 --> 01:11:08,007
Wait here, Mau-Mau.
- Well, OK.

906
01:11:08,500 --> 01:11:10,934
- What did you call him?
- Mau-Mau, that's his wrestling name.

907
01:11:10,935 --> 01:11:13,265
His name is Manolo,
but he thinks it's corny.

908
01:11:14,458 --> 01:11:16,329
Listen, Ivón, do you see Mau-Mau?

909
01:11:16,539 --> 01:11:19,109
Well, someone like him is waiting
for you the day Hugo quits you.

910
01:11:19,119 --> 01:11:21,557
'Cos Hugo will quit you. He won't
marry you before he...

911
01:11:21,559 --> 01:11:24,329
...triumphs as a novelist.
And he'll triumph as a novelist...

912
01:11:24,333 --> 01:11:26,762
...the day I become fire chief.

913
01:11:26,764 --> 01:11:29,737
- Hugo will marry me, Magda.
- If he marries you...

914
01:11:29,739 --> 01:11:31,625
...you'll starve and your life
will be all boredom.

915
01:11:31,628 --> 01:11:33,971
With Mau-Mau I'll learn
some chokeholds, but you?

916
01:11:33,975 --> 01:11:35,655
What have you to do
with literature?

917
01:11:35,869 --> 01:11:39,357
Listen, three million, no more
starving and no more orders...

918
01:11:39,359 --> 01:11:40,747
...from the "Tall One"
and the impresario.

919
01:11:40,749 --> 01:11:43,490
Coats, cars, and a flat
in La Castellana.

920
01:11:43,661 --> 01:11:45,807
The life, Ivón, the life.

921
01:11:47,307 --> 01:11:49,407
- I'll go.
- Sure.

922
01:11:49,587 --> 01:11:53,235
Look, Magda, we're good friends
if we don't talk about that...

923
01:11:53,443 --> 01:11:55,493
...and you know what I mean.

924
01:11:55,495 --> 01:11:56,880
Do you see this key?

925
01:11:57,071 --> 01:11:59,441
He's gonna swallow it.
I swear it.

926
01:12:00,005 --> 01:12:02,198
I'll go there and make him
swallow it.

927
01:12:02,397 --> 01:12:05,373
I've been thinking it would be
better not to go. That's what...

928
01:12:05,376 --> 01:12:08,959
...an educated woman would do
when somebody got her wrong.

929
01:12:09,359 --> 01:12:12,579
But I'm not educated nor
well-mannered. I am...

930
01:12:12,582 --> 01:12:16,957
...a coarse one, Magda. And I
wanna make him swallow it.

931
01:12:19,221 --> 01:12:23,671
Maybe Hugo doesn't have any money,
but he's never talked to me that way.

932
01:12:23,896 --> 01:12:27,126
Can you see the difference, Magda?

933
01:12:28,691 --> 01:12:32,009
No, not you. I know it.

934
01:14:04,100 --> 01:14:06,956
You came to stay with him!
To stay with him!

935
01:14:07,124 --> 01:14:10,420
How could I have been so blind?
How haven't I known before what you were?

936
01:14:11,161 --> 01:14:13,468
Why have I loved you so much?
Why?

937
01:14:13,508 --> 01:14:17,014
The damn money drove you crazy!

938
01:14:17,730 --> 01:14:19,473
Get out of my house!

939
01:14:21,284 --> 01:14:22,558
Get out!

940
01:15:29,704 --> 01:15:33,758
Hugo, please listen to me.

941
01:15:35,108 --> 01:15:38,557
I couldn't quit you even if I'd
get all the money in the world.

942
01:15:38,748 --> 01:15:40,390
Get out of here.

943
01:15:40,498 --> 01:15:44,250
It was the money, you're right.
You can spit on me...

944
01:15:44,612 --> 01:15:47,866
I don't even know him.

945
01:15:48,502 --> 01:15:52,452
But his money drove me crazy.
You can trample on me...

946
01:15:52,848 --> 01:15:57,244
...but you're the one I like.
- Get out, Ivón, get out of here.

947
01:15:58,848 --> 01:16:01,940
- I didn't come to stay with your son.
- You're lying!

948
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:03,437
I swear it.

949
01:16:03,439 --> 01:16:07,595
- You came to stay with him.
- I swear not, ask Magda.

950
01:16:07,598 --> 01:16:10,898
Phone her. She's at the theatre bar,
phone her, she'll tell you.

951
01:16:13,996 --> 01:16:19,877
But you're right, Hugo, I thought
of leaving you because of his money.

952
01:16:20,240 --> 01:16:25,992
I've been an idiot, but I've starved
so many times. I'm tired of fighting.

953
01:16:28,558 --> 01:16:31,890
I know I have no excuse,
but this is the naked truth.

954
01:16:33,382 --> 01:16:37,332
You don't know how a woman can feel
when a man with millions...

955
01:16:37,336 --> 01:16:39,076
...pays attention to her.

956
01:16:40,332 --> 01:16:43,061
When I found my pictures
in his drawer...

957
01:16:43,066 --> 01:16:46,552
- I put them there.
- What?

958
01:16:48,054 --> 01:16:51,898
And it was me who received
your note about that box seat.

959
01:16:52,530 --> 01:16:55,000
And when you phoned him that night
and you talked with him...

960
01:16:55,002 --> 01:16:57,970
...you talked with me.
I am my son, you dummy!

961
01:16:58,162 --> 01:17:00,936
Carlos is just a fantasy.
He has never existed.

962
01:17:01,132 --> 01:17:03,532
You've fallen in love
with the air, stupid.

963
01:17:03,962 --> 01:17:07,230
I've been doing for 19 years what
you did this evening in the...

964
01:17:07,234 --> 01:17:09,284
- ...dressing room with the bracelet.
- You're lying.

965
01:17:09,912 --> 01:17:12,064
You're saying that to take
him out of my head.

966
01:17:12,246 --> 01:17:15,400
Phone Magda, phone her.
I swear I loathe your son.

967
01:17:15,406 --> 01:17:17,700
Shut up!
Do you think I need to cheat you?

968
01:17:17,703 --> 01:17:20,759
- Carlos doesn't exist.
- But he was in the box that evening.

969
01:17:20,762 --> 01:17:22,424
- It was a friend of mine.
- What about the bank?

970
01:17:22,425 --> 01:17:24,958
That's true, don't worry...

971
01:17:24,959 --> 01:17:30,322
...the 3,226,000 pesetas exist.
They're in the bank, just for...

972
01:17:30,325 --> 01:17:33,420
...a few days. This evening the
lawyer phoned me to tell me...

973
01:17:33,425 --> 01:17:36,586
...my aunt's will will be opened
in a week and my son...

974
01:17:36,589 --> 01:17:38,198
...must be there.

975
01:17:38,202 --> 01:17:42,118
Then this farce will be uncovered
and I'll go to jail.

976
01:17:45,100 --> 01:17:48,090
You've gotta find a way out,
make up something, find an excuse...

977
01:17:48,093 --> 01:17:50,422
...for your son not to be
there that day.

978
01:17:50,424 --> 01:17:51,694
More lies?

979
01:17:53,063 --> 01:17:55,350
Kill him!

980
01:17:58,929 --> 01:18:00,608
Didn't you give birth to him?

981
01:18:00,808 --> 01:18:05,668
Think of it, find a way out.
Aren't you a novelist?

982
01:18:24,400 --> 01:18:25,912
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening.

983
01:18:25,922 --> 01:18:28,000
- What a night!
- Dreadful.

984
01:18:28,676 --> 01:18:30,108
Sorry, I hadn't seen you.

985
01:18:30,118 --> 01:18:32,319
- Is that sound the sea?
- Yes, Miss. It's been the same...

986
01:18:32,321 --> 01:18:34,950
...for a week..
- Sounds like it might burst in here.

987
01:18:34,951 --> 01:18:36,102
You've got free rooms, haven't you?

988
01:18:36,104 --> 01:18:40,584
You can have the entire hotel.
In this season of the year Gijon is dead.

989
01:18:40,734 --> 01:18:43,036
- We want three rooms with bathrooms.
- Three?

990
01:18:43,650 --> 01:18:45,294
What's Carlos doing out there?

991
01:18:45,295 --> 01:18:47,661
He's staring at a shop window
beside the hotel.

992
01:18:48,006 --> 01:18:52,241
Hugo, do you hear the sea?
It must be tremendous.

993
01:18:53,038 --> 01:18:54,966
I would like to get closer
to see it.

994
01:18:54,968 --> 01:18:57,324
Would you please go outside and
tell that dummy to come in?

995
01:18:58,196 --> 01:18:59,878
Kids nowadays...

996
01:18:59,879 --> 01:19:03,146
- Is that all your luggage, Sir?
- No, outside there's a big valise.

997
01:19:03,334 --> 01:19:05,610
No, no, let him get it inside,
let him take the trouble.

998
01:19:06,204 --> 01:19:10,119
Well, Carlos, I accept your gift but now
get inside, your father's getting angry.

999
01:19:10,475 --> 01:19:13,717
What? No way. It's too
cold to go outside.

1000
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,378
You'll see it tomorrow.
Come on, hurry up.

1001
01:19:21,219 --> 01:19:23,556
- Do you like it?
- Yeah, very good.

1002
01:19:24,364 --> 01:19:26,165
I would like to take a shower.
Is there hot water?

1003
01:19:26,332 --> 01:19:28,960
Yes, Miss.
It was boiling a while ago.

1004
01:19:29,759 --> 01:19:31,510
That's your room.

1005
01:19:34,302 --> 01:19:36,882
This one is yours.
For you and your son.

1006
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:00,264
- Can we have dinner?
- Sure, but it must be cold meat...

1007
01:20:00,468 --> 01:20:02,964
...look what time it is.
- Cold meat for three...

1008
01:20:03,160 --> 01:20:05,458
- ...and three bottles of beer.
- I'll tell the waitress.

1009
01:20:05,459 --> 01:20:07,132
Hey! And three cups of coffee.

1010
01:20:07,338 --> 01:20:09,118
Ask the lady if she prefers
a cup of tea.

1011
01:20:28,106 --> 01:20:29,514
Miss?

1012
01:20:30,364 --> 01:20:31,988
Miss...

1013
01:20:34,020 --> 01:20:36,492
Wow, she's boiling!

1014
01:21:02,406 --> 01:21:04,225
- It's done.
- OK.

1015
01:21:04,406 --> 01:21:06,703
Help me, take out the L.P.

1016
01:21:09,719 --> 01:21:13,102
- Do you think they'll recognize my voice?
- No, it always changes when it's recorded.

1017
01:21:13,316 --> 01:21:16,206
- When should I start talking?
- In this white spot.

1018
01:21:16,408 --> 01:21:18,638
Go, Ivón, and wet your hair,
don't forget it.

1019
01:21:23,700 --> 01:21:26,214
- How frightening! The sound of the sea!
- Good night, miss.

1020
01:21:26,408 --> 01:21:29,208
- It's been the same all week.
- It must be tremendous.

1021
01:21:29,389 --> 01:21:31,352
- Which is the best place to see it?
- Santa Catalina...

1022
01:21:31,522 --> 01:21:32,968
...a promontory near by.

1023
01:21:32,969 --> 01:21:36,482
But they shouldn't go there,
it's terribly windy.

1024
01:21:36,554 --> 01:21:38,430
The view must be astonishing.

1025
01:21:38,606 --> 01:21:40,210
Why don't we get closer?

1026
01:21:40,215 --> 01:21:42,342
- Will he want to come?
- Sure, he'll want to.

1027
01:21:44,128 --> 01:21:47,036
Hey, Carlos, would you like to...?
Stop that music.

1028
01:21:47,224 --> 01:21:51,294
I warn you, it is very dangerous.
I wouldn't go there even if...

1029
01:21:51,299 --> 01:21:55,279
- Besides, it's very dark.
- Well, it's only once in a lifetime.

1030
01:21:55,282 --> 01:21:56,990
As you like. You're gonna
get wet anyway.

1031
01:21:57,179 --> 01:21:58,836
- I'll wear my raincoat.
- O.K.

1032
01:21:59,003 --> 01:22:01,355
And the umbrella, if the wind
doesn't blow it away.

1033
01:22:01,357 --> 01:22:03,066
I will take both.

1034
01:22:03,068 --> 01:22:04,900
Hugo, tell him to hurry up.

1035
01:22:05,676 --> 01:22:07,309
Carlos, hurry up,
dinner is ready.

1036
01:22:07,319 --> 01:22:08,876
At your service, colonel.

1037
01:22:16,321 --> 01:22:17,837
At your service, colonel.

1038
01:22:18,684 --> 01:22:20,277
At your service, colonel.

1039
01:22:21,103 --> 01:22:23,361
Hugo, Hugo, what's up?

1040
01:22:23,759 --> 01:22:26,809
I've taken fright at you!
What were you thinking of?

1041
01:22:26,900 --> 01:22:28,816
You've been like that
for half an hour.

1042
01:22:29,637 --> 01:22:32,799
- I was thinking of his last words.
- Whose?

1043
01:22:32,966 --> 01:22:36,471
- At your service, colonel.
- Are you crazy? What's this all about?

1044
01:22:36,655 --> 01:22:39,957
Come on, take your coffee.
I'll go to bed because...

1045
01:23:09,068 --> 01:23:10,505
Good night.

1046
01:23:10,711 --> 01:23:13,402
Excuse me if I've turned
this on.

1047
01:23:13,412 --> 01:23:15,797
Good night.
I am the Commissioner.

1048
01:23:16,365 --> 01:23:18,810
Believe me if I tell you I deeply
regret this misfortune.

1049
01:23:19,799 --> 01:23:22,869
- Mind if I ask you some questions?
- At this hour?

1050
01:23:23,064 --> 01:23:25,609
The sooner the better,
so you'll be able...

1051
01:23:25,612 --> 01:23:28,288
- ...to go back to Madrid.
- What do you want to ask?

1052
01:23:30,301 --> 01:23:33,107
I'd like to know which way your
son used to enter the hotel.

1053
01:23:34,378 --> 01:23:36,609
You went upstairs with
the caretaker before him.

1054
01:23:36,698 --> 01:23:39,246
Nobody opened the door
for your son.

1055
01:23:39,669 --> 01:23:41,689
Can you tell me which way he used?

1056
01:23:41,881 --> 01:23:45,288
It seems to be a riddle.
What do I get if I solve it?

1057
01:23:45,289 --> 01:23:48,325
It could influence the judge
to place no obstacle before...

1058
01:23:48,327 --> 01:23:50,177
...your parole.
- Is that a threat?

1059
01:23:50,179 --> 01:23:52,347
- Where did your son come in?
- Through the door.

1060
01:23:52,539 --> 01:23:55,893
The door can't be opened from the
outside, Miss. It closes itself.

1061
01:23:55,895 --> 01:23:57,825
Well, somebody must've opened it.
Who knows?

1062
01:23:57,827 --> 01:24:00,798
Nobody did. And he went up to the second
floor and nobody had told him to.

1063
01:24:01,582 --> 01:24:02,701
Why?

1064
01:24:02,876 --> 01:24:05,823
Have you ever heard a more
stupid interrogation?

1065
01:24:06,001 --> 01:24:08,462
What the hell can we know?
What do you mean with all this?

1066
01:24:08,465 --> 01:24:10,896
- Your son didn't enter the hotel.
- But he did enter.

1067
01:24:11,077 --> 01:24:11,906
You're nuts!

1068
01:24:11,916 --> 01:24:13,503
Next time you insult me,
I'll arrest you.

1069
01:24:13,513 --> 01:24:15,976
- Hey, I warn you!
- Shut up, Hugo, shut up.

1070
01:24:16,177 --> 01:24:18,521
This man is right,
excuse him.

1071
01:24:18,524 --> 01:24:20,647
Then, who signed the register?

1072
01:24:20,719 --> 01:24:23,171
I can't answer something that
is based on the absurdity...

1073
01:24:23,172 --> 01:24:25,494
- ...that my son didn't enter here.
- Listen, I'm gonna tell you clearly...

1074
01:24:25,495 --> 01:24:26,843
...what I think.
Your son didn't enter...

1075
01:24:26,845 --> 01:24:30,067
Wait, I warn you that you're
insulting my...

1076
01:24:30,069 --> 01:24:32,590
...pain as a father with no
scruples.
You enter my room...

1077
01:24:32,592 --> 01:24:35,399
...by force and start a
nonsense interrogation.

1078
01:24:35,605 --> 01:24:38,390
You're going too far and I'll
notify the...

1079
01:24:38,393 --> 01:24:41,179
...General Bureau of Security.
- OK, go ahead.

1080
01:24:41,819 --> 01:24:44,009
But nobody saw your son
entering the hotel.

1081
01:24:44,010 --> 01:24:44,973
That's a lie!

1082
01:24:44,975 --> 01:24:46,890
The caretaker and the waitress
did see him.

1083
01:24:53,896 --> 01:24:57,996
Call the waitress and come
here, both of you.

1084
01:24:58,371 --> 01:25:00,122
Alright, Sir.

1085
01:25:03,721 --> 01:25:05,951
The Commissioner called for us.

1086
01:25:19,662 --> 01:25:20,763
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

1087
01:25:20,773 --> 01:25:22,201
- The Commissioner?
- He's upstairs.

1088
01:25:22,211 --> 01:25:23,605
This man from Madrid
has asked for him.

1089
01:25:23,606 --> 01:25:24,902
I'll tell him.

1090
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:34,577
The Commissioner?

1091
01:25:34,749 --> 01:25:38,222
There's a man from Madrid
asking for you.

1092
01:25:38,405 --> 01:25:40,752
Tell him to wait in the hall.
I'll be right there.

1093
01:25:44,405 --> 01:25:46,029
Come in, come in.

1094
01:25:47,742 --> 01:25:49,857
Did you see the son
of this man?

1095
01:25:50,876 --> 01:25:53,516
- No, I didn't see him.
- She's lying!

1096
01:25:53,698 --> 01:25:56,437
You didn't see him?
Didn't he have dinner with us?

1097
01:25:56,439 --> 01:25:59,432
- No sir, I didn't see him.
- Use your memory.

1098
01:25:59,628 --> 01:26:01,669
Don't you remember I entered here to
ask him if he wants to come with us...

1099
01:26:01,672 --> 01:26:03,878
- ...to the promontory?
- But I didn't see him, Sir.

1100
01:26:04,036 --> 01:26:06,171
I heard him saying he wanted to
go to the promontory, but...

1101
01:26:06,359 --> 01:26:07,905
- Did you hear him?
- Yes.

1102
01:26:07,915 --> 01:26:10,317
- Didn't you see him afterwards?
- No, Sir.

1103
01:26:10,502 --> 01:26:11,869
I swear it.

1104
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:17,104
- Did you hear him? Is that true?
- Yes, Sir.

1105
01:26:17,307 --> 01:26:19,663
- Are you sure?
- Yes, Sir.

1106
01:26:19,756 --> 01:26:22,655
- The caretaker heard him too.
- Why didn't you say it sooner?

1107
01:26:27,397 --> 01:26:29,103
I forgive you, Commissioner...

1108
01:26:29,304 --> 01:26:32,392
...I understand you're
fulfiling your duty.

1109
01:26:33,258 --> 01:26:38,816
I know it sounds like
a novel, but...

1110
01:27:09,497 --> 01:27:12,624
Well, what are we waiting for?
I wanna go to sleep.

1111
01:27:12,865 --> 01:27:15,125
Stop that music!
Who are you to touch that?

1112
01:27:15,552 --> 01:27:18,148
I warn you I have less patience
than the Commissioner.

1113
01:27:18,352 --> 01:27:21,525
Take it easy. I too am
fulfilling my duty.

1114
01:27:21,692 --> 01:27:26,325
Music helps me to think.
Do you want me not to think?

1115
01:28:12,969 --> 01:28:14,377
Hello?

1116
01:28:14,379 --> 01:28:16,605
I want you to hear it too.
Hurry up, come down.

1117
01:28:16,615 --> 01:28:19,730
He has just told me something
very strange.

1118
01:28:19,853 --> 01:28:22,334
He has been investigating
in Madrid on his own.

1119
01:28:22,728 --> 01:28:24,903
- Did he do it personally?
- Personally, yes.

1120
01:28:25,065 --> 01:28:27,973
Come down. You were right,
but you can't imagine why.

1121
01:28:27,977 --> 01:28:30,211
- Hurry up.
- Alright, I'll be right there.

1122
01:28:34,883 --> 01:28:37,225
I'd like to hear that march again.

1123
01:28:43,904 --> 01:28:45,935
What lucky timing.

1124
01:28:49,302 --> 01:28:51,117
Should I wear my raincoat?

1125
01:28:53,502 --> 01:28:55,429
I will take both.

1126
01:28:57,689 --> 01:28:59,530
At your service, colonel.

1127
01:29:00,701 --> 01:29:02,627
- They're suspecting us.
- So what?

1128
01:29:04,065 --> 01:29:06,716
From suspecting to accusing
there's only one step.

1129
01:29:07,059 --> 01:29:08,645
Is there any proof?

1130
01:29:09,041 --> 01:29:12,342
Can't you see that all the elements
of a crime are there?

1131
01:29:12,543 --> 01:29:19,000
The police, the unexpected question,
the anguish and a corpse.

1132
01:29:19,004 --> 01:29:20,517
A corpse?

1133
01:29:20,918 --> 01:29:24,669
The play is completed.
Also the atmosphere.

1134
01:29:25,285 --> 01:29:31,693
A small hotel, supporting characters:
a caretaker and a waitress.

1135
01:29:32,592 --> 01:29:34,372
What do you mean?

1136
01:29:35,705 --> 01:29:39,063
Don't you realize this is as
absurd as in my novels?

1137
01:29:39,449 --> 01:29:42,556
But now I'm not the author,
I am the assassin.

1138
01:29:42,951 --> 01:29:44,700
You're not an assassin.

1139
01:29:44,703 --> 01:29:47,405
It doesn't matter that my
hands aren't really bloody.

1140
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,827
Crimes aren't only committed
with the hands.

1141
01:29:51,013 --> 01:29:53,849
You and I had the will to kill.

1142
01:29:55,305 --> 01:29:57,097
Don't you realize?

1143
01:29:57,099 --> 01:30:01,186
We've jumped over that fence,
we're on the other side.

1144
01:30:01,545 --> 01:30:03,207
What fence are you talking about?

1145
01:30:03,217 --> 01:30:05,669
The one that divides life from death.

1146
01:30:05,825 --> 01:30:09,700
Haven't you seen me lying
and attacking the police?

1147
01:30:09,887 --> 01:30:14,733
I wasn't feigning. I swear,
I felt hate.

1148
01:30:16,019 --> 01:30:17,967
Do you know why, Ivón?

1149
01:30:18,370 --> 01:30:20,541
Nobody can stop this now.

1150
01:30:21,164 --> 01:30:23,469
We've got the red fishes inside.

1151
01:30:24,283 --> 01:30:26,924
- They're here.
- Shut up.

1152
01:30:27,283 --> 01:30:30,650
The red fishes, going 'round
and 'round the fish tank.

1153
01:30:31,518 --> 01:30:34,469
Haven't you ever seen them
going 'round?

1154
01:30:34,908 --> 01:30:40,893
When bloody thoughts arise
they start going 'round...

1155
01:30:41,328 --> 01:30:43,699
...and 'round until you go crazy.

1156
01:30:44,116 --> 01:30:46,430
Until they make you kill.

1157
01:31:13,189 --> 01:31:14,622
- Mr. Commissioner.
- What's the matter?

1158
01:31:14,624 --> 01:31:15,657
They've gone away!

1159
01:31:15,667 --> 01:31:17,746
He's gone first. Both of them
have gone away running.

1160
01:31:17,747 --> 01:31:18,985
- In which direction?
- To the pier.

1161
01:31:18,989 --> 01:31:20,682
- Are they crazy?
- Let them...

1162
01:31:20,854 --> 01:31:22,335
I think it would be better
to call the Guardia Civil.

1163
01:31:22,339 --> 01:31:25,070
There's no time for that. I'm afraid that
man could be a victim of his own lie.

1164
01:31:25,072 --> 01:31:26,637
Do you think he's gonna
commit suicide?

1165
01:32:18,970 --> 01:32:21,543
No, no, no!

1166
01:32:22,396 --> 01:32:24,322
Hugo, Hugo!

1167
01:32:24,503 --> 01:32:26,687
Leave me alone. Get away!

1168
01:32:27,402 --> 01:32:30,316
I've gotta do it,
don't you understand?

1169
01:32:30,511 --> 01:32:35,725
- I can't live this way. I killed him.
- It's not real, everything is a lie!

1170
01:32:37,379 --> 01:32:40,979
I love you, I love you
with all my heart.

1171
01:32:41,561 --> 01:32:45,597
If you jump, I'll jump too.
I don't wanna live without you.

1172
01:32:45,803 --> 01:32:47,575
I need you.

1173
01:32:49,865 --> 01:32:53,898
Confess everything. I'll always
be by your side. Always.

1174
01:32:54,997 --> 01:32:59,399
Forget that lie and tell them
the truth like I'm telling you to.

1175
01:33:01,109 --> 01:33:03,145
I want you by my side, Hugo.

1176
01:33:11,243 --> 01:33:13,539
Tell them the truth.
